# Dataset summary:
# 
# * **Survived** 0 = No, 1 = Yes 
# * **pclass** Ticket class 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
# * **Sex**
# * **Age**: Age in years
# * **Sibsp**: # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic 
# * **Parch** # of parents / children aboard the Titanic
# * **Ticket** Ticket number 
# * **Fare** Passenger fare
# * **Cabin** number embarked 
# * **Port** of Embarkation C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
# 
# Notes:
# 
# * pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
# * * 1st = Upper
# * * 2nd = Middle
# * * 3rd = Lower
# 
# * age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
# 
# * sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# * Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
# * Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
# 
# * parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# * Parent = mother, father
# * Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
# * Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.

# Initially, we get a general dataset structure: shape, columns, numerical and categorical columns.
# It is worth to highlight the amount of NaN values. Dataset shape rows decrease from 891 to 183!

# After all, some conclusion can be made.
# 
# 1. Age distribution graph shows people between 20 and 40 years old are more likely to survive. Also, babies had a good chance to survived.
# 2. Genre histogram shows female are more likely to survived (women and babies first?)
# 3. Class 1 tickets owners are more likely to survived. Did they have access to boats first?
# 4. Finally, passengers with no parent aboard were more likely to survived. They were by their own.
