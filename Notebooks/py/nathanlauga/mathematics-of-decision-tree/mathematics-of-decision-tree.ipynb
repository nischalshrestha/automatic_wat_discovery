Decision Tree </a>\n\nNow let's dive into the math that make the **Decision Tree model** !\n\nTo be honest at the beginning I had some difficulties to really understand how it works because it's really different from linear regression for example. Nevertheless this model has a big **advantage** it's really easy for a human to understand how it gets the predicted result. So to start I search \"Decision Tree\" on Google Image and just took a look on the image to understand. \n\nHere is an example of a Tree :\n\n![](https://annalyzin.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/decision-trees-titanic-tutorial.png)\n\nSo now the question is : **How to know where to split ?** \n\nOn many ressources that I checked they just choose a feature and a value just by visualizing on a plot. But it's not the math that automate the model ! And then I find different notions that define the model : \n* Entropy \n* Gini impurity\n* Information gain\n\nAnd just with that we can build our model !! First let's define those terms.\n\n### <a id=\"2.1\">Entropy</a>\n\nThe entropy is define by this formula : \n$$ H(T) = I_E(p_1,p_2, ... , p_J) = - \\sum_{i=1}^J p_i log_2 p_i$$\n\nwhere $p_1, p_2, ...$ are fractions that add up to 1 and represent the percentage of each class present in the child node (node for a specific value of the feature). And $J$ is the number of classes for this feature.\n\nLet's take an example : we have 10 rows of a feature $X$. Here is the data : $X = [A, A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C]$\n\nTo obtain $p$ for each class we just count the number of value and divise it by the number of elements in $X$ :\n\n$$p_A = \\frac{(number\\space of\\space A)}{(length\\space of\\space X)} = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4 $$\n\n$$p_B = \\frac{(number\\space of\\space B)}{(length\\space of\\space X)} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3 $$\n\n$$p_C = \\frac{(number\\space of\\space C)}{(length\\space of\\space X)} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3 $$\n\nAnd then we can calculate the entropy for this feature :\n\n$= -(p_A log_2 p_A + p_B log_2 p_B + p_C log_2 p_C )\\\\\n= -(0.4 \\times (-1.3219) + 0.3 \\times  (-1.737) + 0.3 \\times  (-1.737) )\\\\\n=-( -0.529 -0.5211 -0.5211 )\\\\\n= 1.571$\n\nLet's code it !"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f2614f7e504833695c1b9513b588bd8a67b03066"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def entropy(data, y_col):\n    # Get all the values for the Y column\n    y_val = data[y_col].value_counts().index.values\n    # Get the vector with the number of element for each Y class\n    tmp = np.array([len(data[data[y_col] == y_val[i]]) for i in range(0, len(y_val))])\n    return sum(-tmp / len(data) * np.log2(tmp / len(data)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1a32f899577fb0d3675c8921fc11bf0a9e3273e6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <a id=\"2.2\">2.2 Gini impurity</a>\n\nThis formula is very similar to the entropy formula :\n\n$$ H(T) =  I_G(p_1,p_2, ... , p_J) = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^J p_i^2$$\n\nSo let's code it üëç"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"34bcad9bacb2e5092c64917aba7aed177f9a334a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def gini_impurity(data, y_col):\n    # Get all the values for the Y column\n    y_val = data[y_col].value_counts().index.values\n    # Get the vector with the number of element for each Y class\n    tmp = np.array([len(data[data[y_col] == y_val[i]]) for i in range(0, len(y_val))])\n    return 1 - sum((tmp / len(data))**2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"721a71e362b2e85417f01cb90b26726581b8c010"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <a id=\"2.3\">2.3 Information gain</a>\n\nThe information gain is really important because it allows us to get the gain for a specific feature on the split. For that it's necessary to introduce the notion of parent and children. The parent is where the data is full and children represent the data filtered by the value of the feature (if we sum the length of each children it gives us the length of the parent).\n\nLet's see an example to understand.

Now the logic is just to compare the gain of each feature and then keep the best ! It's easy on the paper but for categorical feature because we have a limited number of classes. For example for the *Sex* feature it's just *male* and *female*. When it's a continuous feature it's really different for juste a dataset with 1 000 rows we can have like 800 differents values so if we split like it's a categorical value the model is overfitting and it's not really usefull.. \n\nSo how can we deal with continuous feature ? The answer is just to transform it in a categorical value more precisely into a boolean feature (True or False) we can take an example : the *Fare* feature we can choose to split it at the value 50 --> *Fare <= 50*\n\nWe still have a problem for continuous feature : how to choose where to split this feature ? I used an algorithm for that, it has a advantage : you are sure to take the best split and a BIG inconvinient : more data you have slower is your model. For this kernel I will use it because my goal is to understand the model not necessary to optimize it (but if you have suggestion about it do not hesitate).\n\nThe algorithm is simple :\n\n**Step 1 :** Sort the values of the feature : $[v_1, v_2, ..., v_n]$\n\n**Step 2 :** For i = 1 ... n- 1 : get the entropy / gini impurity for a new feature that is : \n$$ data <= \\frac{(v_i + v_{i+1})}{2} $$\nThen we choose the best split.\n\n**Okay, now we have our best feature to split !**\n\nThen we create n leaves where n is the number of class of the feature after that we repeat the operation on the children leaves.\n\nHere is our algorithm to build the Decision Tree model ! It's Great now let's code it (I choose to do it with a DecisionTree class and Leaf class)\n\nTo start we need some informations :\n* The data\n* The name of the column that we want to predict\n* The name of all the categorical feature\n* The name of all the continuous feature\n* Which metric to evaluate our model : gini or entropy\n* The maximum depth of the tree"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ab461cebb3a473f586efb167d60202231c532e01"},"cell_type":"code","source":"class DecisionTree:\n    def __init__(self, data, y_col, cat_cols=[], cont_cols=[], criterion='entropy', max_depth=5):\n        self.data = data\n        self.y_col = y_col\n        self.cat_cols = cat_cols\n        self.cont_cols = cont_cols\n        self.criterion = criterion\n        self.leaves = list()\n        self.max_depth = max_depth if len(cat_cols) > max_depth or len(cont_cols) > 0 else len(cat_cols)\n        \n    def get_best_split_continuous(self, feature_col, data):\n        # Init best gain and best split\n        best_gain, best_split = -1, -1\n        # Get all the values for this feature\n        feat_val = data[feature_col].drop_duplicates().sort_values().reset_index(drop=True).dropna()\n        # Get the information gain for each feature and keep the best\n        for i in range(1, len(feat_val)):\n            split = (feat_val[i -
