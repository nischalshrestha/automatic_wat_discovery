# 

# In[ ]:


#get a list of the features within the dataset
print(train.columns)


# In[ ]:


#see a sample of the dataset to get an idea of the variables
train.sample(5)


# * **Numerical Features:** Age (Continuous), Fare (Continuous), SibSp (Discrete), Parch (Discrete)
# * **Categorical Features:** Survived, Sex, Embarked, Pclass
# * **Alphanumeric Features:** Ticket, Cabin
# 
# #### What are the data types for each feature?
# * Survived: int
# * Pclass: int
# * Name: string
# * Sex: string
# * Age: float
# * SibSp: int
# * Parch: int
# * Ticket: string
# * Fare: float
# * Cabin: string
# * Embarked: string
# 
# Now that we have an idea of what kinds of features we're working with, we can see how much information we have about each of them.
# 

# In[ ]:


#see a summary of the training dataset
train.describe(include = "all")


# #### Some Observations:
# * There are a total of 891 passengers in our training set.
# * The Age feature is missing approximately 19.8% of its values. I'm guessing that the Age feature is pretty important to survival, so we should probably attempt to fill these gaps. 
# * The Cabin feature is missing approximately 77.1% of its values. Since so much of the feature is missing, it would be hard to fill in the missing values. We'll probably drop these values from our dataset.
# * The Embarked feature is missing 0.22% of its values, which should be relatively harmless.

# In[ ]:


#check for any other unusable values
print(pd.isnull(train).sum())


# We can see that except for the abovementioned missing values, no NaN values exist.

# ### Some Predictions:
# * Sex: Females are more likely to survive.
# * SibSp/Parch: People traveling alone are more likely to survive.
# * Age: Young children are more likely to survive.
# * Pclass: People of higher socioeconomic class are more likely to survive.

# ## 4) Data Visualization
# It's time to visualize our data so we can see whether our predictions were accurate! 

# ### Sex Feature

# In[ ]:


#draw a bar plot of survival by sex
sns.barplot(x="Sex", y="Survived", data=train)

#print percentages of females vs. males that survive
print("Percentage of females who survived:", train["Survived"][train["Sex"] == 'female'].value_counts(normalize = True)[1]*100)

print("Percentage of males who survived:", train["Survived"][train["Sex"] == 'male'].value_counts(normalize = True)[1]*100)


# As predicted, females have a much higher chance of survival than males. The Sex feature is essential in our predictions.

# ### Pclass Feature

# In[ ]:


#draw a bar plot of survival by Pclass
sns.barplot(x="Pclass", y="Survived", data=train)

#print percentage of people by Pclass that survived
print("Percentage of Pclass = 1 who survived:", train["Survived"][train["Pclass"] == 1].value_counts(normalize = True)[1]*100)

print("Percentage of Pclass = 2 who survived:", train["Survived"][train["Pclass"] == 2].value_counts(normalize = True)[1]*100)

print("Percentage of Pclass = 3 who survived:", train["Survived"][train["Pclass"] == 3].value_counts(normalize = True)[1]*100)


# As predicted, people with higher socioeconomic class had a higher rate of survival. (62.9% vs. 47.3% vs. 24.2%)

# ### SibSp Feature

# In[ ]:


#draw a bar plot for SibSp vs. survival
sns.barplot(x="SibSp", y="Survived", data=train)

#I won't be printing individual percent values for all of these.
print("Percentage of SibSp = 0 who survived:", train["Survived"][train["SibSp"] == 0].value_counts(normalize = True)[1]*100)

print("Percentage of SibSp = 1 who survived:", train["Survived"][train["SibSp"] == 1].value_counts(normalize = True)[1]*100)

print("Percentage of SibSp = 2 who survived:", train["Survived"][train["SibSp"] == 2].value_counts(normalize = True)[1]*100)


# In general, it's clear that people with more siblings or spouses aboard were less likely to survive. However, contrary to expectations, people with no siblings or spouses were less to likely to survive than those with one or two. (34.5% vs 53.4% vs. 46.4%)

# ### Parch Feature

# In[ ]:


#draw a bar plot for Parch vs. survival
sns.barplot(x="Parch", y="Survived", data=train)
plt.show()


# People with less than four parents or children aboard are more likely to survive than those with four or more. Again, people traveling alone are less likely to survive than those with 1-3 parents or children.

# ### Age Feature

# In[ ]:


#sort the ages into logical categories
train["Age"] = train["Age"].fillna(-0.5)
test["Age"] = test["Age"].fillna(-0.5)
bins = [-1, 0, 5, 12, 18, 24, 35, 60, np.inf]

test['AgeGroup'] = pd.cut(test["Age"], bins, labels = labels)

#draw a bar plot of Age vs. survival
sns.barplot(x="AgeGroup", y="Survived", data=train)
plt.show()


# Babies are more likely to survive than any other age group. 

# ### Cabin Feature
# I think the idea here is that people with recorded cabin numbers are of higher socioeconomic class, and thus more likely to survive. Thanks for the tips, [@salvus82](https://www.kaggle.com/salvus82) and [Daniel Ellis](https://www.kaggle.com/dellis83)!

# In[ ]:

#calculate percentages of CabinBool vs. survived
print("Percentage of CabinBool = 1 who survived:", train["Survived"][train["CabinBool"] == 1].value_counts(normalize = True)[1]*100)

print("Percentage of CabinBool = 0 who survived:", train["Survived"][train["CabinBool"] == 0].value_counts(normalize = True)[1]*100)
#draw a bar plot of CabinBool vs. survival
sns.barplot(x="CabinBool", y="Survived", data=train)
plt.show()


# People with a recorded Cabin number are, in fact, more likely to survive. (66.6% vs 29.9%)
