        "As an aspiring data scientist, this notebook is my first attempt at performing and presenting a thorough analysis of a dataset on Kaggle.com: **Titanic - machine learning from disaster**. Based on a list of passengers with several attributes (name, sex, class, cabin, etc.), we have to predict who will survive the catastrophe. In order to do this, we shall look at the training data and scrutinise the different predictors one by one, engineering new features if neccessary for a better model. For the feature engineering - especially being a novice in machine learning - the forums on Kaggle have inspired me with quite a few ideas. Subsequently, we will construct a model for prediction by training a forest of decision trees on the features of the training data. This done, we will now apply this model to the test data (that does **not** contain the information about survival) and predict who is expected to survive - and who will sink. As this is an ongoing project, I will continuously update the model with better-constructed features and parameters. \n",

As a result, we could see some intriguing implications of some of the features on surviving the disaster: gender, social standing, fare per capita and age were among the most important predictors. After munging the data, I used a tree-based model for prediction: the random forest classifier of the sklearn package. However, since the data is relatively small, a single iteration of model building is not enough: one has to do cross-validation which will help refine the accuracy of the predicions. This is the next stage in the work coming up soon - so stay tuned!"
