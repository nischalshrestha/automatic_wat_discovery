It makes use of some basic data exploration techniques, and makes use of an ensemble-model for classification. \nI managed to get a public LB score of about 82% after more than 30 tries, more than half of which were for different models, like Random Forests, XGBoost etc. My score drastically improved after I plugged in this Voting classifier, so, robustness of model rewards a lot here.\nThis was my first real and independently done Machine Learning problem and I learnt a lot, and hopefully, this helps you. Also, this is **my first Kaggle kernel**, so please feel free to point out corrections and to suggest better approaches.\n\n## **Before Starting out**\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a delightful challenge, having a pretty compact set of features and not many rows, which is perfect for us beginners. Its design and inherent density of interweaving contexts, as I found out, constantly reward the analyst for their time. But, also, as a warning sign, the data is rather volatile, probably because its dependent quantity depends on a lot of human decisions and chance.\nI would advise a read-through of [what exactly took place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic#Maiden_voyage) on that night of April, 1912. Apart from that, the [general structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic#Dimensions_and_layout) and build of the ship, may help a bit. And lastly, a very basic idea of the socio-economic conditions at the time may help you understand the results better, even if it doesn't help you improve the model.\n\nOk, lets go.\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing required libaries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"335fdc14ac99be5e5c7cb145afe38fb90193c94e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Data Exploration**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"19941e6223fadf91dfd352dea9fb15a3a6533591","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest_data = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\nsubmission = pd.read_csv('../input/gender_submission.csv')\n\ntrain_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ac4b7a8bf6ea5e50a529115bf959a017f787996c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Looking at this gives a general idea about what's on our hands.

If you know where this is going, you are welcome to skip this section, but if you don't, read on. So, people come to take a look at the jar, lean in for a closer look and make some calculations. Then, they go to the organisers and give their estimate. Now, because we know statistics enough to know that \"more makes merry\", we'll bring our favourite chair and sit right next to the organisers and note down all the entries. After all of them are done, we can just take an average of all the values and give that as our entry. This is somewhat similar to what a voting classifier does. It asks all of the models what they think about the problem, and at the end takes an average, or in this case, picks the majority vote. This helps in balancing any errors that a particular model might face in front of a particular row in the dataset, since all the models are inherently and conceptually different to one another. This method of majority vote is referred to as \"hard voting\".\n\nBut, what we are going to use is a bit different, soft voting. Going back to the same problem, what if you know all the people who were participating in the competition, or even better, what if you asked them how they felt about their answer? You could ask them to rate their confidence in their guess on a scale of 1-10. This might help you in establishing a better average of values. You could, very easily, assign weights to their answers and then, take an average. This is known as \"soft voting\". And that is what we are going to use in our model."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"aba37727dee18eafdcdbb0e8208b718b77b087e9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Fitting the Voting Classifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"e18af4e1e31e6f1a71a7aa47bef5b67d98f95990"},"cell_type":"code","source":"estimators_list = []\n\ndt = DecisionTreeClassifier()\nestimators_list.append(('Decision Tree', dt))\n\nrf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=3001)\nestimators_list.append(('Random Forest', rf))\n\nada = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=1000,learning_rate=0.00001)\nestimators_list.append(('AdaBoost', ada))\n\ngrad_boost = GradientBoostingClassifier(max_features='sqrt',n_estimators=1000,learning_rate=0.00001)\nestimators_list.append(('Gradient Boosting', grad_boost))\n\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=19)\nestimators_list.append(('KNN', knn))\n\nlogreg = LogisticRegression()\nestimators_list.append(('Logistic Regression', logreg))\n\nsvc = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1, gamma=0.1, probability=True)\nestimators_list.append(('SVC', svc))\n\nensemble = VotingClassifier(estimators_list, voting='soft')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"90cd6f96cdbc6305c66d4edf733768796052bebd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this ensemble model, I have made use of 7 very different machine learning models.

There are a lot of other things as well which I didn't include. I spent most of time visualising and exploring the data and trying to make new features, but I've only included the significantly successful ones. I tuned the parameters for different component-models as well, but I haven't included the particular code section for it. Also, I spent some time trying to figure out what component-models to use in this Voting Classifier, primarily by hit-and-trial. The ones included above are the ones that gave the best results. Also, strangely, I was getting a better result with sklearn's Gradient Boosting Classifier than XGBoost, so I replaced it.\n\nAs with everything I would say there is a scope for improvement. For me, most certainly, its about improving my Python skills. For the model, parameter tuning could help. I am also thinking about a new feature which groups according to ethnicities because I want to see if that was a major factor in saving lives or not. Also, extracting some useful information out of Ticket and Cabin would be great.\n\nWell, thanks for reading and I'll see you around!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5233e90af1deff3b2eca9433fee0a10f015b2d5a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Credits**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"62b5fda863d44b016e5c89137304bcb920334f91"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here are some kernels which helped me get an idea on how to begin working on such a project:\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/exploring-survival-on-the-titanic\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/erikbruin/titanic-2nd-degree-families-and-majority-voting\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/konstantinmasich/titanic-0-82-0-83\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
