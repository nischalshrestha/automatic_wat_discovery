We will go over the basics of data storage, manipulation, and visualization with Python. Then we will implement a statisical learning model to develop a classification predictor. To see how well our predictor performs, the answers from our predictor will be submitted to a Kaggle competition and scored. Links to more advanced data manipulation and analyses will be referenced thoroughout.\n\n**Warning:** Our goal is provide a starting point for Python data analytics, not to teach Python from the ground up or to address statistical learning at a detailed level. There will be references included for those who wants more details.\n\nThe challenge is to predict survival on the Titanic. We will attempt this by implementing a statistical learning method called the Naive Bayesian Classifier. To implement and train our classifier we use  three Python packages: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit Learn. Numpy includes tools for linear algebra, statistical anlysis, and matrix manipulation. Pandas helps us store and manipulate data. Seaborn is used to visualize the data stored in Pandas. Finally, Scikit Learn includes the data analysis tools that we will use develop and train our predictive model.\n\nThere are three sections of this notebook:\n1. Data wrangling\n    1. Load data\n    2. FIll in missing data\n2. Feature visualization\n3. Modeling\n    1. Load model\n    2. Train model\n    3.

This means that there are 263 missing entries for Age! We can also see that Age is \"float64\" data type - the entries are numbers and can have decimals. Before we can use the Age feature, we need to fill in these missing values.\n\nThe other parts of the output provide similar information. The line for the feature \"Sex\" shows that there are 1309 entries for this feature, which means it does not have any missing data! Sex is an \"object\" datatype - in this case a string for 'male' or 'female' . Later, we will convert these categorical labels to numbers so that they can be interpreted by our model.\n\nThe line for the passenger class feature, \"PClass,\" also has 1309 entries,  The datatye for PClass is \"Int64\" - it can only be a real number without decimals.
