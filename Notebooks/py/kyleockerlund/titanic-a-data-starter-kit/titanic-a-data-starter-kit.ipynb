For the most part, if you find a dataset or competition on Kaggle, you can get your entire set up done online! Simply go to the competition/dataset you want to use, then go to the Kernals tab. Another option for you to use, If you find someone else's Kernel that you really like and want to use as a base point, then you'll need to \"Fork\" it. Think like you're making a fork in the road in terms of the code base. Basically, go to that code's page, and hit the \"Fork\" button. That'll create a copy of that code for you to edit. \n\nFrom there, hit \"New Kernal\" and select notebook. Then, get coding! Otherwise, if you want to use something that *isn't* on Kaggle, you're going to have to use a local set up.

Maybe we can come up with another variable that might help? Whatever the case may be, graphs help shed a lot of light on the subject.\n\nAs for how to go about that, there are actually a lot of ways. The seaborn library, imported above, is powerful. However, pandas has a very, very simple graph library that can get us up and running. To use it, simply use the command data_frame_name[\"ColumnName\"].plot(kind= \"hist\")  *Note*: A full list of graph types is available here: [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html](http://)\n\nYou can also set things like the title, axes labels, whatever you want! Again, a full list of the parameters available is available in the documentation above. [If you would like to learn more about visualization, I recommend you work on your Pandas DataFrame skills, then seaborn. This video talks about some DataFrame commands that pick out things from your DataFrame: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvpNA7bC8cs]. Specifically, he talks about iloc, ix, and loc, and how you use them. They're annoyingly similar, and it'll take some practice and reference to figure out when to use which but... Once you get there, it gives you a LOT of flexibility. If you have any other pandas questions, he's the guy to answe rthem. Once you have a finner tuned control of the data sets, I recommend giving this a go for seaborn: Note, you may not be able to actually *download* the data without setting up a whole desktop enviornment, but the lessons generalize well to what we're doing here: (http://). https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e25e9fef8e183d2cf75466be30a3acc7736c2eaa","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_train[\"Age\"].plot(kind=\"hist\", title=\"Ages of Titanic Passengers\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"36b4a71629505887a101097953d4eb483d8ce8cc"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*Technique:* Sometimes, we want to compare subcategories of things.

We understand the data. Now, we need to get the data ready for the model. This can take a bit of creativity --- More often than not, these models all require numerical data. How do we handle categorical data? Plus, how do we handle missing values? Outliers? Do we need to normalize anything? Are there useless variables, or can we add anything? \n\nThis all takes some careful thought, and ultimately makes or breaks a good model. Heck, that last question opens the door to the entire field of feature engineering. (Really recommend reading up on that more here: [https://elitedatascience.com/feature-engineering)] - Or, if you want the really long version: [http://adataanalyst.com/machine-learning/comprehensive-guide-feature-engineering/](http://))\n\nIn this case, we're just going to use the pandas \"Drop\" command to get rid of a few useless columns, and use a cool technique to represent categorical data.\n\n*Technique:* When we want to convert categorical data into numerical data, we can use a process called one-hot encoding. Essentially, we take a column like \"Embarked\", and we split it into three or so columns. If the person embarked from location A, they get a \"1\" in the \"Embarked_A\" column. If they embarked from location B, they get a \"1\" in the \"Embarked_B\" column, etc. We can use the pandas \"get_dummies(x)\" command for this.\n\nLastly, we're going to want to handle missing values. Some techniques involve regressing an accurate value, others involve filling in the mean. In this case, we're just going to replace the missing values with 0 for the sake of simplicity.

Otherwise, take some time to stop and play around with things! NOTE: You can probably stop at about the 32 minute mark for the sake of this. You won't be needing classes or objects, we have enough libraries for that!\n\nOther than that, really it's just look into what interests you. If you're into visualization, try to mess around with Matplotlib and seaborn. If you're into the models, try to bounce around the Wikipedia page, get the lay of the land. If you're into some of the more mathematically involved stuff, consider giving Principle Component Analysis a go. Basically, it re-expresses data along it's most significant eigenvectors, which can reduce a 9142 dimmensional matrix to a 10 dimmensional one or something like that.
