This course is designed as a series of kernels that guides you through different topics and hopefully you can discover some hidden treasures that push you forward on your data science road. You don't have to pick the courses in sequence if you are only interested in some topics that are covered. If you are new I would recommend you to take them step by step one after another. ;-)\n\nJust fork the kernels and have fun! :-)\n\n* [Prepare to start](https://www.kaggle.com/allunia/titanic-dive-through-prepare-to-start): Within this kernel we will prepare our data such that we can use it to proceed. Don't except nice feature selection or extraction techniques here because we will stay as simple as possible. Without a clear motivation we won't change any features. Consequently we are only going to explore how to deal with missing values and how to turn objects to numerical values. In the end we will store our prepared data as output such that we can continue working with it in the next kernel.\n* [MyClassifier](https://www.kaggle.com/allunia/titanic-dive-through-myclassifier): Are you ready to code your own classifier? Within this kernel you will build logistic regression from scratch. By implementing the model ourselves we can understand the assumptions behind it. This knowledge will help us to make better decisions in the next kernel where we will use this model and build some diagnosis tools to improve its performance.\n* [The feature cave](https://www.kaggle.com/allunia/titanic-dive-through-feature-cave): By using our own logistic regression model we will explore how we can improve by adding a bias term and why we should encode categorical features. \n* **Feature scaling and outliers**: Why is it important to scale features and to detect outliers? By analyzing the model structure we will discover how our gradients and our model performance are influenced by these topics.

For example all samples with negative values survived the disaster and the positive ones died.
