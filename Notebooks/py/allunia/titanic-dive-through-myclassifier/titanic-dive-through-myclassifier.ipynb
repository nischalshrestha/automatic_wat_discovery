This course is designed as a series of kernels that guides you through different topics and hopefully you can discover some hidden treasures that push you forward on your data science road. You don't have to pick the courses in sequence if you are only interested in some topics that are covered. If you are new I would recommend you to take them step by step one after another. ;-)\n\nJust fork the kernels and have fun! :-)\n\n* [Prepare to start](https://www.kaggle.com/allunia/titanic-dive-through-prepare-to-start): Within this kernel we will prepare our data such that we can use it to proceed. Don't except nice feature selection or extraction techniques here because we will stay as simple as possible. Without a clear motivation we won't change any features. Consequently we are only going to explore how to deal with missing values and how to turn objects to numerical values. In the end we will store our prepared data as output such that we can continue working with it in the next kernel.\n* **MyClassifier**: Are you ready to code your own classifier? Within this kernel you will build logistic regression from scratch. By implementing the model ourselves we can understand the assumptions behind it. This knowledge will help us to make better decisions in the next kernel where we will use this model and build some diagnosis tools to improve its performance.\n* [The feature cave](https://www.kaggle.com/allunia/titanic-dive-through-feature-cave): By using our own logistic regression model we will explore how we can improve by adding a bias term and why we should encode categorical features. \n* [Feature scaling and outliers](https://www.kaggle.com/allunia/titanic-dive-through-feature-scaling-and-outliers/edit): Why is it important to scale features and to detect outliers? By analyzing the model structure we will discover how our gradients and our model performance are influenced by these topics.

But how to predict the survival of passengers in the test set? \n\n### Deciding survival by threshold\n\nOne simple idea could be to multiply each feature $x_{d}$ with some parameter $w_{d}$ and sum up all terms to obtain a quantity $g$ that helps us to make a decision for one passenger if he or she survived or not: \n\n$$g = x_{1} \\cdot w_{1} + ... + x_{ 7} \\cdot w_{7} = \\sum_{d=1}^{D=7} x_{d} \\cdot w_{d}$$\n\n$$y=\n    \\begin{cases}\n      0, & \\text{if}\\ g > \\tau \\\\\n      1, & \\text{otherwise}\n    \\end{cases} \n$$\n\nNow we would predict that a passenger has not survived if its $g$ is higher than some threshold $\\tau$ and otherwise the passenger survived. By forcing the parameter w to be shared over all passengers in the train set we would gain a general way to calculate the survival of new passengers like those in the test set. But with this approach we are running into problems:\n\n* How shall we set $\\tau$ and the 7 parameter $w_{d}$ to obtain the best predictions in train and test?\n* Finding the best predictions with least errors between prediction and target labels in the train set sounds like an optimization task. Consequently we may need gradients with repsect to parameters w and tau. But how should we do that with our prediction function y? Using a threshold has caused some trouble as the [Heaviside-function](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function) we used is not differentiable. \n\nHow can we solve this problem? \n\n### A smooth approximation\n\nAs you might have read in the wikipedia article we could use a smooth approximation of the heaviside function -  the logistic function. Let's go even one step further and take the [sigmoid function](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) $\\sigma$ as a special and simple case of the logistic function. Then our prediction function would turn to:\n\n$$ y = \\sigma \\left( \\sum_{d=1}^{D=7} x_{d} \\cdot w_{d} \\right) $$\n\n$$ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-x)}$$\n\nHah, Nice! We get rid of the threshold parameter $\\tau$ and the only thing we are left off is to find optimal parameter w that minimize the errors between our predictions and target values of survival in the train set.

If so, I'm glad to tell you that the water in our diving bay will become a bit more turbulent from now on. :-) We have to think about how to measure the error E between the target labels t and our predictions y of the survival of passengers in the train set. A naive approach would be the following: Just take the absolute difference of target and prediction for each passenger $n$ and take the mean of those errors....\n\n$$ E = \\frac{1} {N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} |t_{n} - y_{n}| $$\n\nWell, ... this mean absolute error is not a good idea. We want to minimize this function with respect to our parameter w and the absolute value function is not differentiable at point 0. We can circumvent this by switching to the mean squared difference of targets and predictions. In that case we would work with the so called mean squared error function but unfortunately this is again not a good choice. Why?\n\n$$ E = \\frac{1} {N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} ||t_{n} - y_{n}||^{2}$$\n\nThe mean squared error is a commonly used error metric for problems that have targets that live in a continous space. This is not true in our case. We have only two discrete values, 0 and 1, that stands for \"not survived\" or \"survived\". Consequently we should use some error metric that is related to this discrete nature. But how to do that? We could try to find a distribution that tells us how likely it is that our predictions are close to the targets. Luckily there is a distribution out there - the Bernoulli distribution:\n\n$$ p_{n}(t_{n}) = y_{n}^{t_{n}} \\cdot (1 - y_{n})^{(1-t_{n})} $$\n\nFor each passenger we can calculate how probable it is that our prediction is close to the target.

By assuming that the targets were drawn indepentently from the Bernoulli distribution we can multiply all passenger probabilities to obtain the overall probability that the prediction outputs Y matches the targets T:\n\n$$ P(T|X,W) = \\prod_{n=1}^{N} y_{n}^{t_{n}} \\cdot (1 - y_{n})^{(1-t_{n})} $$\n\nThis function is also called likelihood function.

You have managed the main part of this course: We have derived the loss and the gradient of the loss with respect to parameters. Consequently we can now use this information to minimize the loss and make our model learn. We will do this by using a numerical method, namely gradient descent: \n\nIt's a bit like playing \"Hit The Pot\" in a mountain landscape where the Pot is given by the deepest valley. Imagine you would stand on some hill with eyes covered. You have a spoon in your hand and every time you hit the ground someone tells you where the direction is steepest. Then, you are able to take a step of a fixed size. Afterwards you start again: hit the ground... a voice in the off tells you where to go and you take a step. Finally and hopefully you will end up close to the deepest valley and the change of your height is small each step you take from now on. Perhaps you will oscillate around it somehow as your step is fixed and you jump a bit over the deepest point. But you hit the pot and win a prize! :-) \n\n**It's worth to think about it** - What kind of problems can occur when you play *Hit the Pot* in a mountain landscape?  \n\nIn our case the heigth of the mointain landscape stand for the loss we want to minimize. And of course this problem is not three dimensional. Our landscape has as many dimensions as features. To start our game we chose some inital parameters w - a rondomly chosen point in that loss landscape. In MyClassifier this is already implemented in the __init__. Playing \"hit the pot\" now means that we make a step of fixed size $\\eta$ in the direction of the steepest descent of our loss. We will do this stepwise again and again and hopefully we will end up in the minimum we were looking for. Hence to make our classifier work, we have to implement this concept of gradient descent. For this purpose you will write the update of parameters between two consequtive steps $\\tau$ and $\\tau + 1$ for each parameter $w_{d}$:\n\n$$ w_{d}^{\\tau + 1} = w_{d}^{\\tau} - \\eta \\cdot \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w^{\\tau}_{d}}$$\n\n**Now, it's your turn:**\n\nImplement the gradient method that returns a vector of gradients with d elements that hold the derivatives $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_{d}}$.

Do you think it's a good idea that the features contribute to their gradients with different magnitudes caused by their range of values? Why would it be better to have equally valued ranges over all features? If you are not sure: Imagine you would play *hit the pot* and your like to take a fixed size step. In one dimension x you can make very steep steps but in the second dimension y you can only have a weak slope and your step results in low hight differences. What do you need to reach the minimum of BOTH dimensions? What would be if you could make equally hight distances per step in both dimensions?\n2. What causes the age contributions to be unbalanced? Is this a problem at all? What do you think is the consequence for the rate of false positive and false negative predictions in the end of our learning phase?\n3. How should we work with outliers in our feature distributions?\n4. What about discrete categorical feature distributions with more than 2 values like Embarked or Pclass?  \n\nWe will come back to this topic in the next diving kernel, äh, course ;-)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f6c773eff55702ca01521c63920f9c91fcd4c6d3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Station 6 - Bring your model to life\n\nYeah!
