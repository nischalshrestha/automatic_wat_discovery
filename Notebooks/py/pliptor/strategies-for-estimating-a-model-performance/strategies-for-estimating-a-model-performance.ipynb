The question was about strategies for estimating\nmodel performance on unseen data. This may not be a question straightforward to answer because we have\nseveral variables to think about and assumptions to be made. Although this is not a Titanic kernel, I had to find a home for it. Hopefully you'll find the results useful or at least entertaining.\n\nOne possible strategy is to leave a portion of the train data out that is not touched during training.\nThis is typically used in one of the last steps to check how well our model does with guaranteed unseen data. The remaining data is used to tune the model using K-Fold cross validation (CV). K-Fold CV also outputs information about how well it may do with unseen data. However, a valid concern is that in K-Fold CV we no longer have guaranteed unseed data by design. The question is how CV and hold-out compare with each other. \n\nStatistically, since the hold-out set is typically smaller than the entire CV set, it should suffer from more variance. I thought then about a [**theorem**](https://www.kaggle.com/questions-and-answers/48707#286918) in the discussion. It states that as long as the partitions are statistically very similar (more so in an information-theoretical sense), the estimation for unseen data using a hold-out set should give the same average estimate as in the cross validation. If that's the case, CV only would then suffice. The approach might be objectionable if we absolutely don't want to use data that has been used during training to forcast performance of unseen data. It is really a design choice. Hopefully we may see pros and cons. This topic is also discussed by [DanB](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker) in this tutorial [**notebook**](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/cross-validation/notebook). We provide here a controlled experimental platform. \n\nSince mathematical proofs are quite abstract, this notebook tests the theorem in practice with synthesized data. This way we can precisely control the data and understand the laws and mechanisms behind. \n\nThe synthesized data has four independent features A, B, C and D. Each may take the discrete values {0,1,2,3}. A class is then associated by the following non-linear formula CLASS = A + B*C + A*D. We then generate a data frame with this rule.\nNext, 20% of the rows have features randomly scrambled. With this, if a classifier is trained on this data, we expect 80% of classification precision. Let's then examine what happens...\n\n1. [Creating independent features A, B, C and D](#features)\n\n2. [Creating data frame](#dataframe)\n3. [Adding classification errors](#add_errors)\n4.
