Doing so for simple features such as gender (public score **0.76555**) or passenger class (public score **0.65550**) poses no problem and we know those scores are the optimum solutions under those restrictions. Other examples can be found [**here**](https://www.kaggle.com/pliptor/how-am-i-doing-with-my-score). Single feature prediction is not so straightforward for features such as **Name, Ticket** or **Cabin** because or their more complex structure. \n\nThe notebook is also motivated by this [**Dec 2014 discussion**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/11127). It is therein discussed that close ticket numbers (rather than just identical) are often tied to people that traveled together. \n\nWe will parse and dissect the Ticket value into 400+ features that intends to capture the relation between its owners. Finally, we will apply the **KNeighbors** algorithm solve it. We will optimize the KNeighbors parameter with GridSearch and also compute the cross validation to estimate the expected public score. \n\nI recently found a kernel or discussion that mentions that the ticket number is correlated to Pclass (if you happen to know the the kernel/discussion, I'd like to include proper credit here). We will verify that fact in this kernel. Consequently we expect prediction using the Ticket-only information to be no worse than the [**optimal solution for Pclass-only solution**](https://www.kaggle.com/pliptor/optimal-titanic-for-pclass-only-0-65550)   (**public score 0.65550**).

The Ticket feature was transformed to a 449-feature data frame. The features are supposed to capture fine details on how passengers were connected by just the ticket values! The prediction was then made with a KNneighbor optimizer tuned with a cross-validated grid search. As a by-product, we found the estimated accuracy for unseen data to be **0.7168**. The obtained public score is **0.7129**, which indicates the model is fairly well tuned to unseen data. The score is also significantly better than the optimal Pclass-only solution (public score **0.65550**)\n\nFuture work: Unfortunately we can't guarantee this solution for Ticket-only is optimal. It might be still possible to improve it both from the perspective of feature generation and from KNneighbor optimization.\nI hope to do it at some time. \n\nPlease let me know if you have questions or comments!\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
