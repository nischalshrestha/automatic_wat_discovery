However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\n\n## Question and problem definition\n\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\n\n## Workflow goals\n\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\n\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\n\n**Correlation** One can approach the problem based on available features (also known as input variables or parameters) within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a correlation among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\n\n**Using Dummy variables** For the modeling stage, depending on the choice of model algorithm, one may require all categorical features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. For example, converting text values to numeric values so that it can be input into our training model.\n\n**Complete Missing Data ** Data preparation also require us to replace any missing values within a feature with a value that makes sense.\n\n**Correcting** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to correct these values or exclude the samples containing errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our parameters. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\n\n**Feature Engineering** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation and completion goals.\n\n**Plotting** This is selecting the proper visualization charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"52368e7c708f83e402b7049e5008ab763cb4218c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## On To The Python Code"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"847a9b3972a6be2d2f3346ff01fea976d92ecdb6","_cell_guid":"5767a33c-8f18-4034-e52d-bf7a8f7d8ab8","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Python libraries for data analysis and wrangling\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport random as rnd\n\n# Python visualization libraries\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Python machine learning libraries\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC, LinearSVC\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2d307b99ee3d19da3c1cddf509ed179c21dec94a","_cell_guid":"6b5dc743-15b1-aac6-405e-081def6ecca1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Acquire data\n\nThe Python Pandas packages helps us work with our datasets.

We want to do this early in our project and compare these quick correlations with correlations later in the project after we make our model.\n\n**Completing.**\n\n1.

We may want to complete the Embarked feature as it may also correlate with survival or another important feature.\n\n**Correcting and Dropping Variables.**\n\n1. Ticket feature may be dropped from our analysis as it contains high ratio of duplicates (22%) and there may not be a correlation between Ticket and survival.\n2. Cabin feature may be dropped as it is highly incomplete or contains many null values both in training and test dataset.\n3. PassengerId may be dropped from training dataset as it does not contribute to survival.\n4. Name feature is relatively non-standard, may not contribute directly to survival, so it can be dropped.\n\n**Creating.**\n\n1. We may want to create a new feature called Family based on Parch and SibSp to get total count of family members on board.\n2. We may want to engineer the Name feature to extract Title as a new feature.\n3. We may want to create new feature for Age bands.
