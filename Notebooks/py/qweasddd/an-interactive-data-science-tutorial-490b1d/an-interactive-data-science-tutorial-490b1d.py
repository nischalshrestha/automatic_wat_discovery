# # 1. Business Understanding
# 
# ## 1.1 Objective
# Predict survival on the Titanic
# 
# ## 1.2 Description
# The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
# 
# One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
# 
# In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
# 
# **Before going further, what do you think is the most important reasons passangers survived the Titanic sinking?**

# ## 2.4 Statistical summaries and visualisations
# 
# To understand the data we are now going to consider some key facts about various variables including their relationship with the target variable, i.e. survival.
# 
# We start by looking at a few lines of the data
# 
# *Select the cell below and run it by pressing the play button.*

# In[ ]:


# Run the code to see the variables, then read the variable description below to understand them.
titanic.head()


# **VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:**
# 
# We've got a sense of our variables, their class type, and the first few observations of each. We know we're working with 1309 observations of 12 variables. To make things a bit more explicit since a couple of the variable names aren't 100% illuminating, here's what we've got to deal with:
# 
# 
# **Variable Description**
# 
#  - Survived: Survived (1) or died (0)
#  - Pclass: Passenger's class
#  - Name: Passenger's name
#  - Sex: Passenger's sex
#  - Age: Passenger's age
#  - SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
#  - Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
#  - Ticket: Ticket number
#  - Fare: Fare
#  - Cabin: Cabin
#  - Embarked: Port of embarkation
# 
# [More information on the Kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

# ### 2.4.1 Next have a look at some key information about the variables
# An numeric variable is one with values of integers or real numbers while a categorical variable is a variable that can take on one of a limited, and usually fixed, number of possible values, such as blood type.
# 
# Notice especially what type of variable each is, how many observations there are and some of the variable values.
# 
# An interesting observation could for example be the minimum age 0.42, do you know why this is?
# 
# *Select the cell below and run it by pressing the play button.*

# In[ ]:


titanic.describe()


# ### 2.4.2 A heat map of correlation may give us a understanding of which variables are important
# *Select the cell below and run it by pressing the play button.*

# In[ ]:


plot_correlation_map( titanic )


# ### 2.4.3 Let's further explore the relationship between the features and survival of passengers 
# We start by looking at the relationship between age and survival.
# 
# *Select the cell below and run it by pressing the play button.*

# In[ ]:


# Plot distributions of Age of passangers who survived or did not survive
plot_distribution( titanic , var = 'Age' , target = 'Survived' , row = 'Sex' )


# Consider the graphs above. Differences between survival for different values is what will be used to separate the target variable (survival in this case) in the model. If the two lines had been about the same, then it would not have been a good variable for our predictive model. 
# 
# Consider some key questions such as; what age does males/females have a higher or lower probability of survival? 

# ### 2.4.3 Excersise 1: Investigating numeric variables
# It's time to get your hands dirty and do some coding! Try to plot the distributions of Fare of passangers who survived or did not survive. Then consider if this could be a good predictive variable.
# 
# *Hint: use the code from the previous cell as a starting point.*

# In[ ]:


# Excersise 1
# Plot distributions of Fare of passangers who survived or did not survive
plot_distribution( titanic , var = 'Fare' , target = 'Survived' , row = 'Age' )


# ### 2.4.4 Embarked
# We can also look at categorical variables like Embarked and their relationship with survival.
# 
# - C = Cherbourg  
# - Q = Queenstown
# - S = Southampton

# In[ ]:


# Plot survival rate by Embarked
plot_categories( titanic , cat = 'Embarked' , target = 'Survived' )


# ### 2.4.4 Excersise 2 - 5: Investigating categorical variables
# Even more coding practice! Try to plot the survival rate of Sex, Pclass, SibSp and Parch below. 
# 
# *Hint: use the code from the previous cell as a starting point.*
# 
# After considering these graphs, which variables do you expect to be good predictors of survival? 

# In[ ]:


# Excersise 2
# Plot survival rate by Sex
plot_categories( titanic , cat = 'Sex' , target = 'Survived' )


# In[ ]:


# Excersise 3
# Plot survival rate by Pclass
plot_categories( titanic , cat = 'Pclass' , target = 'Survived' )


# In[ ]:


# Excersise 4
# Plot survival rate by SibSp
plot_categories( titanic , cat = 'SibSp' , target = 'Survived' )


# In[ ]:


# Excersise 5
# Plot survival rate by Parch
plot_categories( titanic , cat = 'Parch' , target = 'Survived' )


# # 3. Data Preparation

# ## 3.1 Categorical variables need to be transformed to numeric variables
# The variables *Embarked*, *Pclass* and *Sex* are treated as categorical variables. Some of our model algorithms can only handle numeric values and so we need to create a new variable (dummy variable) for every unique value of the categorical variables.
# 
# This variable will have a value 1 if the row has a particular value and a value 0 if not. *Sex* is a dichotomy (old school gender theory) and will be encoded as one binary variable (0 or 1).
# 
# *Select the cells below and run it by pressing the play button.*

# In[ ]:


# Transform Sex into binary values 0 and 1
sex = pd.Series( np.where( full.Sex == 'male' , 1 , 0 ) , name = 'Sex' )


# In[ ]:


# Create a new variable for every unique value of Embarked
embarked = pd.get_dummies( full.Embarked , prefix='Embarked' )
embarked.head()


# In[ ]:


# Create a new variable for every unique value of Embarked
pclass = pd.get_dummies( full.Pclass , prefix='Pclass' )
pclass.head()


# ## 3.2 Fill missing values in variables
# Most machine learning alghorims require all variables to have values in order to use it for training the model. The simplest method is to fill missing values with the average of the variable across all observations in the training set.
# 
# *Select the cells below and run it by pressing the play button.*

# In[ ]:


# Create dataset
imputed = pd.DataFrame()

# Fill missing values of Age with the average of Age (mean)
imputed[ 'Age' ] = full.Age.fillna( full.Age.mean() )

# Fill missing values of Fare with the average of Fare (mean)
imputed[ 'Fare' ] = full.Fare.fillna( full.Fare.mean() )

imputed.head()

    if len( ticket ) > 0:
        return ticket[0]
    else:

# # 5. Evaluation
# Now we are going to evaluate model performance and the feature importance.
# 
# ## 5.1 Model performance
# We can evaluate the accuracy of the model by using the validation set where we know the actual outcome. This data set have not been used for training the model, so it's completely new to the model. 
# 
# We then compare this accuracy score with the accuracy when using the model on the training data. If the difference between these are significant this is an indication of overfitting. We try to avoid this because it means the model will not generalize well to new data and is expected to perform poorly.

# Score the model
print (model1.score( train_X , train_y ) , model1.score( valid_X , valid_y ))

# ## 5.2 Feature importance - selecting the optimal features in the model
# We will now try to evaluate what the most important variables are for the model to make the prediction. The function below will only work for decision trees, so if that's the model you chose you can uncomment the code below (remove # in the beginning)  and see the feature importance.
# 
# *Select the cell below and run it by pressing the play button.*

# 2. Try adding new features in step 3.4.1
#     * Do this by adding them in to the function in the feature section.
# 
# 
# **The winner is the one to get the highest scoring model for the validation set**

# # 6. Deployment
