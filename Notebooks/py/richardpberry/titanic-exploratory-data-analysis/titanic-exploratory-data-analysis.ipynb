These are the key observations:\n- The data is very clean. No suspect labels or outliers were observed\n- There are many missing values for Age and Cabin.

The significance of this is difficult to determine but it may serve as a useful proxy for filling missing cabin data\n- Age values are skewed to the left, with most passengers (male and female) between around 16-25 years of age\n- Fare values seem to follow an exponential decay. Extremely high fare values do not appear to be outliers but may represent the ticket cost for a group of 1st class passengers\n- Most adult passengers (male and female) were not accompanied by children \n\nAs for correlations:\n- Age, Pclass, Sex are strongly correlated with survival. Missing age values should be inferred to maximise this correlation\n- Fare is also correlated, but as it is also related to Pclass this may be of secondary importance\n- Parch may only be meaningfully associated with survival for young passengers. Somewhat suprisingly, adult passengers travelling with children do not appear to be more likely to survive than adult passengers without children\n- Logically, cabin may be a very useful predictor of survival, though it needs cleaning work before it can be used.
