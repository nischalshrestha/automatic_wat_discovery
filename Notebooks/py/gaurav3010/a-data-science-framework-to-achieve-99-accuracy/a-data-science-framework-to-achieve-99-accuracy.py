# # RMS Titanic Data Analysis
# 

# 
# RMS Titanic sank in the early morning of 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean, four days into the ship's maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The largest passenger liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg at around 23:40 (ship's time)[a] on Sunday, 14 April 1912. Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 (ship's time; 05:18 GMT) on Monday, 15 April, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, which made it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.
# 
# Titanic received six warnings of sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen compartments to the sea. Titanic had been designed to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more, and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink. They used distress flares and radio (wireless) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats. In accordance with existing practice, Titanic's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board simultaneously; therefore, with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away, there was no safe refuge for many of the passengers and crew. Compounding this, poor management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full.
# 
# As a result, when Titanic sank, over a thousand passengers and crew were still on board. Almost all those who jumped or fell into the water either drowned or died within minutes due to the effects of cold shock and incapacitation. RMS Carpathia arrived on the scene about an hour and a half after the sinking and rescued the last of the survivors by 09:15 on 15 April, some nine and a half hours after the collision. The disaster shocked the world and caused widespread outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax regulations, and the unequal treatment of the three passenger classes during the evacuation. Subsequent inquiries recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations, leading to the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today.

# ### This Seems not many Passanger survived in this accident 
# 
# Out of 891 passengers in training data, only 350 survived i.e Only ***38.4%*** of the total training data survived the crash.
# 
# We need to drill down more to get better result from the data and see which categories of the passengers did survive and who didn't.
# 
# We will try to check the survival rate by using the different features of the dataset. Some of the features being **Sex, Port Of Embarcation, Age**,etc.
# 
# First let us understand the different types of features.

# ## Types Of Features
# 
# ### Categorical Features:
# A categorical variable is one that has two or more categories and each value in that feature can be categorised by them.For example, gender is a categorical variable having two categories (male and female). Now we cannot sort or give any ordering to such variables. They are also known as **Nominal Variables**.
# 
# **Categorical Features in the dataset: Sex,Embarked.**
# 
# ### Ordinal Features:
# An ordinal variable is similar to categorical values, but the difference between them is that we can have relative ordering or sorting between the values. For eg: If we have a feature like **Height** with values **Tall, Medium, Short**, then Height is a ordinal variable. Here we can have a relative sort in the variable.
# 
# **Ordinal Features in the dataset: PClass**
# 
# ### Continous Feature:
# A feature is said to be continous if it can take values between any two points or between the minimum or maximum values in the features column.
# 
# **Continous Features in the dataset: Age**

# ## Analysing of The Features

# ## Sex--- Categorical Feature

# In[ ]:

ax[1].set_title('Sex:Survived vs Dead')
plt.show()


# This looks interesting.Number of men on the ship is more than the number of women. Still the number of women saved is almost twice the number of male saved. The survival rates for a **women on the ship is around 75% while that for men in around 18-19%.**
# 
# Lets check other features.

# ## Pclass --> Ordinal Feature

# In[ ]:

# People say **Money Can't Buy Everything**. But we can clearly see that Passenegers Of Pclass 1 were given a very high priority while rescue. Even though the the number of Passengers in Pclass 3 were a lot higher, still the number of survival from them is very low, somewhere around **25%**.
# 
# For Pclass 1 %survived is around **63%** while for Pclass2 is around **48%**. So money and status matters. Such a materialistic world.
# 
# Lets Dive in little bit more and check for other interesting observations. Lets check survival rate with **Sex and Pclass** Together.

# In[ ]:


pd.crosstab([data.Sex,data.Survived],data.Pclass,margins=True).style.background_gradient(cmap='RdPu')


# In[ ]:


sns.factorplot('Pclass','Survived',hue='Sex',data=data,palette='rainbow')
plt.show()


# We use **FactorPlot** in this case, because they make the seperation of categorical values easy.
# 
# Looking at the **CrossTab** and the **FactorPlot**, we can easily infer that survival for **Women from Pclass1** is about **95-96%**, as only 3 out of 94 Women from Pclass1 died. 
# 
# It is evident that irrespective of Pclass, Women were given first priority while rescue. Even Men from Pclass1 have a very low survival rate.
# 
# Looks like Pclass is also an important feature. Lets analyse other features.

# ## Age Cont.. Feature

# ### Observations:
# 
# 1)The number of children increases with Pclass and the survival rate for passenegers below Age 10(i.e children) looks to be good irrespective of the Pclass.
# 
# 2)Survival chances for Passenegers aged 20-50 from Pclass1 is high and is even better for Women.
# 
# 3)For males, the survival chances decreases with an increase in age.

# As we had seen earlier, the Age feature has **177** null values. To replace these NaN values, we can assign them the mean age of the dataset.
# 
# But the problem is, there were many people with many different ages. We just cant assign a 4 year kid with the mean age that is 29 years. Is there any way to find out what age-band does the passenger lie??
# 
# ***Now*** We will Look into the feature, where we can see that the names have a salutation like Mr or Mrs. Thus we can assign the mean values of Mr and Mrs to the respective groups.
# 

# In[ ]:


#here we will extract prefix or solutation from training data.

    data['Initial']=data.Name.str.extract('([A-Za-z]+)\.') 

    
#Printing number persone by their designation or prefix.

# Okay so here we are using the Regex: **[A-Za-z]+)\.**. So what it does is, it looks for strings which lie between **A-Z or a-z** and followed by a **.(dot)**. So we successfully extract the Initials from the Name.

# In[ ]:


#Here we will check Initials by their gender.
pd.crosstab(data.Initial,data.Sex).T.style.background_gradient(cmap='rainbow')

# ### Observations:
# 
# 1)Maximum passenegers boarded from S. Majority of them being from Passenger Class 3.
# 
# 2)The Passengers from C look to be lucky as a good proportion of them survived. The reason for this maybe the rescue of all the Pclass1 and Pclass2 Passengers.
# 
# 3)The Embark S looks to the port from where majority of the rich people boarded. Still the chances for survival is low here, that is because many passengers from Pclass3 around **81%** didn't survive. 
# 
# 4)Port Q had almost 95% of the passengers were from Pclass3.

# In[ ]:


sns.factorplot('Pclass','Survived',hue='Sex',data=data,col='Embarked',palette='summer')
plt.show()


# ### Observations:
# 
# 1)The survival chances are almost 1 for those women who belongs to Pclass 1 and Pclass 2 irrespective of the Pclass3.
# 
# 2)Port S looks to be very unlucky for Pclass3 Passenegers as the survival rate for both men and women is very low.
# 
# 3)Port Q looks to be unlukiest for Men, as almost all were from Pclass 3.
# 

# ### Filling NaN Value for Embarked
# 
# As we saw that maximum passengers boarded from Port S, we replace NaN with S.

# Check for NaN Value in Data for Embarked if any if False means no NaN Value in our data
data.Embarked.isnull().any()


# ## Discrete Feature Data for Siblings on the Ship 
# This feature represents whether a person is alone or with his family members.
# 
# Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
# 
# Spouse = husband, wife 

# In[ ]:


pd.crosstab([data.SibSp],data.Survived).style.background_gradient(cmap='cool')

sns.barplot('SibSp','Survived',data=data,ax=ax[1],palette='magma')
ax[1].set_title('SibSp vs Survived')

plt.close(2)
plt.show()


# In[ ]:


pd.crosstab(data.SibSp,data.Pclass).style.background_gradient(cmap='PiYG')


# ### Observations:
# 
# 
# The barplot and factorplot shows that if a passenger is alone onboard with no siblings, he have 34.5% survival rate. The graph roughly decreases if the number of siblings increase. This makes sense. That is, if I have a family on board, I will try to save them instead of saving myself first. Surprisingly the survival for families with 5-8 members is **0%**. The reason may be Pclass??
# 
# The reason is **Pclass**. The crosstab shows that Person with SibSp>3 were all in Pclass3. It is imminent that all the large families in Pclass3(>3) died.

# ## Parch

# In[ ]:


pd.crosstab(data.Parch,data.Pclass).style.background_gradient(cmap='summer_r')


# The crosstab again shows that larger families were in Pclass3.

# In[ ]:


f,ax=plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(20,8))

ax[0].set_title('Parch vs Survived')
sns.factorplot('Parch','Survived',data=data,ax=ax[1])
ax[1].set_title('Parch vs Survived')
plt.close(2)
plt.show()


# ### Observations:
# 
# Here too the results are quite similar. Passengers with their parents onboard have greater chance of survival. It however reduces as the number goes up.
# 
# The chances of survival is good for somebody who has 1-3 parents on the ship. Being alone also proves to be fatal and the chances for survival decreases when somebody has >4 parents on the ship.

# ## Fare--> Continous Feature

# In[ ]:


print('Highest Fare was:',data['Fare'].max())
print('Lowest Fare was:',data['Fare'].min())
print('Average Fare was:',data['Fare'].mean())


# The lowest fare is **0.0**. Wow!! a free luxorious ride. 

# In[ ]:


f,ax=plt.subplots(1,3,figsize=(20,8))
sns.distplot(data[data['Pclass']==1].Fare,ax=ax[0],color='#7B241C')
ax[0].set_title('Fares in Pclass 1')
sns.distplot(data[data['Pclass']==2].Fare,ax=ax[1])
ax[1].set_title('Fares in Pclass 2')
sns.distplot(data[data['Pclass']==3].Fare,ax=ax[2],color='#186A3B')
ax[2].set_title('Fares in Pclass 3')
plt.show()


# There looks to be a large distribution in the fares of Passengers in Pclass1 and this distribution goes on decreasing as the standards reduces. As this is also continous, we can convert into discrete values by using binning.

# ## Observations in a Nutshell for all features:
# **Sex:** The chance of survival for women is high as compared to men.
# 
# **Pclass:**There is a visible trend that being a **1st class passenger** gives you better chances of survival. The survival rate for **Pclass3 is very low**. For **women**, the chance of survival from **Pclass1** is almost 1 and is high too for those from **Pclass2**.   **Money Wins!!!**. 
# 
# **Age:** Children less than 5-10 years do have a high chance of survival. Passengers between age group 15 to 35 died a lot.
# 
# **Embarked:** This is a very interesting feature. **The chances of survival at C looks to be better than even though the majority of Pclass1 passengers got up at S.** Passengers at Q were all from **Pclass3**. 
# 
# **Parch+SibSp:** Having 1-2 siblings,spouse on board or 1-3 Parents shows a greater chance of probablity rather than being alone or having a large family travelling with you.

# ## Correlation Between The Features

# In[ ]:


sns.heatmap(data.corr(),annot=True,cmap='RdYlGn',linewidths=0.2) #data.corr()-->correlation matrix
fig=plt.gcf()
fig.set_size_inches(10,8)
plt.show()


# ### Interpreting The Heatmap
# 
# The first thing to note is that only the numeric features are compared as it is obvious that we cannot correlate between alphabets or strings. Before understanding the plot, let us see what exactly correlation is.
# 
# **POSITIVE CORRELATION:** If an **increase in feature A leads to increase in feature B, then they are positively correlated**. A value **1 means perfect positive correlation**.
# 
# **NEGATIVE CORRELATION:** If an **increase in feature A leads to decrease in feature B, then they are negatively correlated**. A value **-1 means perfect negative correlation**.
# 
# Now lets say that two features are highly or perfectly correlated, so the increase in one leads to increase in the other. This means that both the features are containing highly similar information and there is very little or no variance in information. This is known as **MultiColinearity** as both of them contains almost the same information.
# 
# So do you think we should use both of them as **one of them is redundant**. While making or training models, we should try to eliminate redundant features as it reduces training time and many such advantages.
# 
# Now from the above heatmap,we can see that the features are not much correlated. The highest correlation is between **SibSp and Parch i.e 0.41**. So we can carry on with all features.

# ## Part2: Feature Engineering and Data Cleaning
# 
# Now what is Feature Engineering?
# 
# Whenever we are given a dataset with features, it is not necessary that all the features will be important. There maybe be many redundant features which should be eliminated. Also we can get or add new features by observing or extracting information from other features.
# 
# An example would be getting the Initals feature using the Name Feature. Lets see if we can get any new features and eliminate a few. Also we will tranform the existing relevant features to suitable form for Predictive Modeling.

# ## Age_band
# 
# #### Problem With Age Feature:
# As I have mentioned earlier that **Age is a continous feature**, there is a problem with Continous Variables in Machine Learning Models.
# 
# **Eg:**If I say to group or arrange Sports Person by **Sex**, We can easily segregate them by Male and Female.
# 
# Now if I say to group them by their **Age**, then how would you do it? If there are 30 Persons, there may be 30 age values. Now this is problematic.
# 
# We need to convert these **continous values into categorical values** by either Binning or Normalisation. I will be using binning i.e group a range of ages into a single bin or assign them a single value.
# 
# Okay so the maximum age of a passenger was 80. So lets divide the range from 0-80 into 5 bins. So 80/5=16.
# So bins of size 16.

# In[ ]:


data['Age_band']=0
data.loc[data['Age']<=16,'Age_band']=0
data.loc[(data['Age']>16)&(data['Age']<=32),'Age_band']=1
data.loc[(data['Age']>32)&(data['Age']<=48),'Age_band']=2
data.loc[(data['Age']>48)&(data['Age']<=64),'Age_band']=3
data.loc[data['Age']>64,'Age_band']=4
data.head(2)


# In[ ]:


#checking the number of passenegers in each Age Band
data['Age_band'].value_counts().to_frame().style.background_gradient(cmap='OrRd')


# In[ ]:


sns.factorplot('Age_band','Survived',data=data,col='Pclass')
plt.show()


# True that..the survival rate decreases as the age increases irrespective of the Pclass.
# 
# ## Family_Size and Alone
# At this point, we can create a new feature called "Family_size" and "Alone" and analyse it. This feature is the summation of Parch and SibSp. It gives us a combined data so that we can check if survival rate have anything to do with family size of the passengers. Alone will denote whether a passenger is alone or not.

# In[ ]:


data['Family_Size']=0
data['Family_Size']=data['Parch']+data['SibSp']#family size
data['Alone']=0
data.loc[data.Family_Size==0,'Alone']=1#Alone

f,ax=plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(18,6))
sns.factorplot('Family_Size','Survived',data=data,ax=ax[0],palette='summer')
ax[0].set_title('Family_Size vs Survived')
sns.factorplot('Alone','Survived',data=data,ax=ax[1],palette='binary')
ax[1].set_title('Alone vs Survived')
plt.close(2)
plt.close(3)
plt.show()


# In[ ]:


sns.factorplot('Alone','Survived',data=data,hue='Sex',col='Pclass')
plt.show()


# It is visible that being alone is harmful irrespective of Sex or Pclass except for Pclass3 where the chances of females who are alone is high than those with family.
# 
# ## Fare_Range
# 
# Since fare is also a continous feature, we need to convert it into ordinal value. For this we will use **pandas.qcut**.
# 
# So what **qcut** does is it splits or arranges the values according the number of bins we have passed. So if we pass for 5 bins, it will arrange the values equally spaced into 5 seperate bins or value ranges.

# In[ ]:


data['Fare_Range']=pd.qcut(data['Fare'],4)
data.groupby(['Fare_Range'])['Survived'].mean().to_frame().style.background_gradient(cmap='summer_r')


# As discussed above, we can clearly see that as the **fare_range increases, the chances of survival increases.**
# 
# Now we cannot pass the Fare_Range values as it is. We should convert it into singleton values same as we did in **Age_Band**

# In[ ]:


data['Fare_cat']=0
data.loc[data['Fare']<=7.91,'Fare_cat']=0
data.loc[(data['Fare']>7.91)&(data['Fare']<=14.454),'Fare_cat']=1
data.loc[(data['Fare']>14.454)&(data['Fare']<=31),'Fare_cat']=2
data.loc[(data['Fare']>31)&(data['Fare']<=513),'Fare_cat']=3


# In[ ]:


sns.factorplot('Fare_cat','Survived',data=data,hue='Sex')
plt.show()


# Clearly, as the Fare_cat increases, the survival chances increases. This feature may become an important feature during modeling along with the Sex.
# 
# ## Converting String Values into Numeric
# 
# Since we cannot pass strings to a machine learning model, we need to convert features loke Sex, Embarked, etc into numeric values.

# In[ ]:


data['Sex'].replace(['male','female'],[0,1],inplace=True)
data['Embarked'].replace(['S','C','Q'],[0,1,2],inplace=True)
data['Initial'].replace(['Mr','Mrs','Miss','Master','Other'],[0,1,2,3,4],inplace=True)


# ### Dropping UnNeeded Features
# 
# **Name**--> We don't need name feature as it cannot be converted into any categorical value.
# 
# **Age**--> We have the Age_band feature, so no need of this.
# 
# **Ticket**--> It is any random string that cannot be categorised.
# 
# **Fare**--> We have the Fare_cat feature, so unneeded
# 
# **Cabin**--> A lot of NaN values and also many passengers have multiple cabins. So this is a useless feature.
# 
# **Fare_Range**--> We have the fare_cat feature.
# 
# **PassengerId**--> Cannot be categorised.

# # Part3: Predictive Modeling
# 
# We have gained some insights from the EDA part. But with that, we cannot accurately predict or tell whether a passenger will survive or die. So now we will predict the whether the Passenger will survive or not using some great Classification Algorithms.Following are the algorithms I will use to make the model:
# 
# 1)Logistic Regression
# 
# 2)Support Vector Machines(Linear and radial)
# 
# 3)Random Forest
# 
# 4)K-Nearest Neighbours
# 
# 5)Naive Bayes

# The accuracy of a model is not the only factor that determines the robustness of the classifier. Let's say that a classifier is trained over a training data and tested over the test data and it scores an accuracy of 90%.
# 
# Now this seems to be very good accuracy for a classifier, but can we confirm that it will be 90% for all the new test sets that come over??. The answer is **No**, because we can't determine which all instances will the classifier will use to train itself. As the training and testing data changes, the accuracy will also change. It may increase or decrease. This is known as **model variance**.
# 
# To overcome this and get a generalized model,we use **Cross Validation**.
# 
# 
# # Cross Validation
# 
# Many a times, the data is imbalanced, i.e there may be a high number of class1 instances but less number of other class instances. Thus we should train and test our algorithm on each and every instance of the dataset. Then we can take an average of all the noted accuracies over the dataset. 
# 
# 1)The K-Fold Cross Validation works by first dividing the dataset into k-subsets.
# 
# 2)Let's say we divide the dataset into (k=5) parts. We reserve 1 part for testing and train the algorithm over the 4 parts.
# 
# 3)We continue the process by changing the testing part in each iteration and training the algorithm over the other parts. The accuracies and errors are then averaged to get a average accuracy of the algorithm.
# 
# This is called K-Fold Cross Validation.
# 
# 4)An algorithm may underfit over a dataset for some training data and sometimes also overfit the data for other training set. Thus with cross-validation, we can achieve a generalised model.

# ### Interpreting Confusion Matrix
# 
# The left diagonal shows the number of correct predictions made for each class while the right diagonal shows the number of wrong prredictions made. Lets consider the first plot for rbf-SVM:
# 
# 1)The no. of correct predictions are **491(for dead) + 247(for survived)** with the mean CV accuracy being **(491+247)/891 = 82.8%** which we did get earlier.
# 
# 2)**Errors**-->  Wrongly Classified 58 dead people as survived and 95 survived as dead. Thus it has made more mistakes by predicting dead as survived.
# 
# By looking at all the matrices, we can say that rbf-SVM has a higher chance in correctly predicting dead passengers but NaiveBayes has a higher chance in correctly predicting passengers who survived.

# ### Hyper-Parameters Tuning
# 
# The machine learning models are like a Black-Box. There are some default parameter values for this Black-Box, which we can tune or change to get a better model. Like the C and gamma in the SVM model and similarly different parameters for different classifiers, are called the hyper-parameters, which we can tune to change the learning rate of the algorithm and get a better model. This is known as Hyper-Parameter Tuning.
# 
# We will tune the hyper-parameters for the 2 best classifiers i.e the SVM and RandomForests.
#

# # Ensembling
# 
# Ensembling is a good way to increase the accuracy or performance of a model. In simple words, it is the combination of various simple models to create a single powerful model.
# 
# Lets say we want to buy a phone and ask many people about it based on various parameters. So then we can make a strong judgement about a single product after analysing all different parameters. This is **Ensembling**, which improves the stability of the model. Ensembling can be done in ways like:
# 
# 1)Voting Classifier
# 
# 2)Bagging
# 
# 3)Boosting.

# ## Voting Classifier
# 
# It is the simplest way of combining predictions from many different simple machine learning models. It gives an average prediction result based on the prediction of all the submodels. The submodels or the basemodels are all of diiferent types.

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

                                              ('LR',LogisticRegression(C=0.05)),
                                              ('DT',DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0)),
                                              ('NB',GaussianNB()),

cross=cross_val_score(ensemble_lin_rbf,X,Y, cv = 10,scoring = "accuracy")
print('The cross validated score is',cross.mean())


# ## Bagging
# 
# Bagging is a general ensemble method. It works by applying similar classifiers on small partitions of the dataset and then taking the average of all the predictions. Due to the averaging,there is reduction in variance. Unlike Voting Classifier, Bagging makes use of similar classifiers.
# 
# #### Bagged KNN
# 
# Bagging works best with models with high variance. An example for this can be Decision Tree or Random Forests. We can use KNN with small value of **n_neighbours**, as small value of n_neighbours.

result=cross_val_score(model,X,Y,cv=10,scoring='accuracy')
print('The cross validated score for bagged Decision Tree is:',result.mean())


# ## Boosting
# 
# Boosting is an ensembling technique which uses sequential learning of classifiers. It is a step by step enhancement of a weak model.Boosting works as follows:
# 
# A model is first trained on the complete dataset. Now the model will get some instances right while some wrong. Now in the next iteration, the learner will focus more on the wrongly predicted instances or give more weight to it. Thus it will try to predict the wrong instance correctly. Now this iterative process continous, and new classifers are added to the model until the limit is reached on the accuracy.

# #### AdaBoost(Adaptive Boosting)
# 
# The weak learner or estimator in this case is a Decsion Tree.  But we can change the dafault base_estimator to any algorithm of our choice.
