A pretty standard route for people trying to start of with ML and a decent one too. In this notebook, I tried to jot down the steps in building a predictive model for Titanic and some resources alongside. If its your first problem, its important that you take pauses in between, ponder over what you've done till then, read a bit about the step and proceed (Don't just read - read and try that segment - Its an iterative process). Having said this, there's information explosion around and its very easy to get lost (I know I'm adding more!). Its very essential that you find 2-3 kernels or notebooks which are understandable by you and stick to them.   \n", "\n", "This model achieves a score of 0.7894, which is in the top 5% of all submissions at the time of this writing. Now that I've reached here (from 0.72248), I finally can understand and appreciate why this is a great introductory modeling exercise.

It might seem a bit of a      patience tester, but worth the go through if you've time and especially if you are more of a data analyst than a scientist. A              bottom-up approach would be to look at the [example gallery](http://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), pick the graph        you want to represent your variables with and dive in.

Its relatively slow paced and gets too basic at times. But I think everyone should watch it (even at 2x). Error analysis is an integral part of modeling.
