So, for beginners in ML I highly recommend it a try.\n\nI created this code using python to predict the survival labels for the test set in this competition. The highest score I got was 0.77990 for the accuracy of the model. In the following paragraphs I will present the steps I went through to get this score.\n\n**Note:** Keep in mind that this tutorial is just as a simple starting point and will be useful for beginners. Many more explorations and optimizations could be done. If you have any comments about this tutorial please let me know. \n\nIn this tutorial I will present basic steps of a data science pipeline:\n\n#### 1. Data exploration and visualization  \n   - Explore dataset\n   - Choose important features and visualize them according to survival/non-survival\n   \n#### 2. Data cleaning, Feature selection and Feature engineering\n   - Null values\n   - Encode categorical data\n   - Transform features\n   \n#### 3. Test different classifiers \n   - Logistic Regression (LR)\n   - K-NN\n   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n   - Naive Bayes\n   - Random Forest (RF)\n \n "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"27b81e09132fb09511a5fcf7d925b9fb766e9cc3","_cell_guid":"e077f539-ad91-7277-41d9-1f1246092189"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First let's start by importing the essential libraries to work with dataframes (**pandas**), numeric values (**numpy**) and visualization (**matplotlib.pyplot**)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1c2a278c46e7e31c5b8c2c49b4240aba95e533bb","_cell_guid":"2dfc55af-0bc1-cae3-14b1-b16ccbaa9a16","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing the libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2a30885a2dc5487417bf2e7d6cb45311476f9118","_cell_guid":"8c4c9f57-5fb2-4037-6b92-ff3ffa6f87c8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let's import the csv file with the training dataset.

We will be using this to encode the **\"Embarked\"** feature. But first, as **\"Embarked\"** has two NaN values we need to take care of these missing values. In this approach, I will provide the 'S' category because it is the most frequent in the data. After this, it is then possible to use the **get_dummies** and get three new columns (Embarked_C,\tEmbarked_Q, Embarked_S) which are called dummy variables (they assign ‘0’ and ‘1’ to indicate membership in a category). The previous **\"Embarked\"** can be dropped from X as it will not be needed anymore and we can now concatenate the X dataframe with the new **\"Embarked\"** which has the three dummy variables. Finally, as the number of dummy variables necessary to represent a single feature is equal to the number of categories in that feature minus one, we can remove one of the dummies created, lets say Embarked_S, for example. This will not remove any information because by having the values from Embarked_C and\tEmbarked_Q the algorithm can easily understand the values from the remaining dummy variable (when Embarked_C and Embarked_Q are '0' Embarked_S will be '1', otherwise it will be '0').
