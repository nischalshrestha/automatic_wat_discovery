Here is an extract from wikipead about the same:\n> Those aboard Titanic were ill-prepared for such an emergency. In accordance with accepted practices of the time, where ships were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels, Titatic only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board; if the ship had carried her full complement of about 3,339 passengers and crew, only about a third could have been accommodated in the lifeboats. The crew had not been trained adequately in carrying out an evacuation. The officers did not know how many they could safely put aboard the lifeboats and launched many of them barely half-full. Third-class passengers were largely left to fend for themselves, causing many of them to become trapped below decks as the ship filled with water. The \"women and children first\" protocol was generally followed when loading the lifeboats, and most of the male passengers and crew were left aboard.\n\nSome key pointers from the above:\n1. \"women and children first\" protocol - Women and children had a higher survival probability because of this protocol\n2. Third-class passengers were largely left to fend for themselves\n\n\n**So if a crew had to pick a person to load on the lifeboat, I would only be taking 3 things into consideration, the Class, Sex and Age.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"fd0c3eff1843b4b13cebcaecd1ae6826a415ade0","scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#selecting columns which are going to make sense to my analysis\ntrain_data = train_data.loc[:,['Survived','Pclass','Sex','Age']]\ntrain_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true,"_uuid":"1795a4d93d318755714457a255c0d20d49c7e1ae"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a55b1032cb39e8798aa92fc372ac24ae99614f1b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A closer look at the description of the dataset indicates, we have around 177 people for whom there is not age data available.
