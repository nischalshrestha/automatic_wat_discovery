In this Kernel, I will try to step by step build a ML model using sklearn to predict the outcomes of each passenger aboard the titanic. This guide is meant for people starting with data visualization, analysis and Machine Learning. If that sounds like you, then you're in the right place! It is not as difficult as you think to understand.\n\n*Please upvote and share if this helps you!! Also, feel free to fork this kernel to play around with the code and test it for yourself. If you plan to use any part of this code, please reference this kernel!* I will be glad to answer any questions you may have in the comments. Thank You! \n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e5f4bfc42ab2cc96dc924cd12ea144e2ee1d76dd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Update\nThank you all so much for the support and reading this kernel! I am very inspired to keep learning and I hope you are too. I am in the progress of making more kernels for more competitions as well as ones for data visualization and statistics.
