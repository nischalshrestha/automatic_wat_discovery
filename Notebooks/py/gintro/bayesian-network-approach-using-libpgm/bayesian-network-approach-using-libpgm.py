# ## Bayesian network approach using libpgm
# 
# In this tutorial I show how to implement a Bayesian network on the Titanic dataset. I employ the python Libpgm library for modeling the network in three different and independent ways: 
#     1. the structure and the parameters (CPD) at each node are defined and calculated manually, the library is thus used to encode this information. 
#     2. the library is applied to calculate the structure of the network
#     3. the library calculates both the strucuture and the parameters of the network

# ## Data Dictionary
# 
# * Variable	Definition	Key
# * survival 	Survival 	0 = No, 1 = Yes
# * pclass 	Ticket class 	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
# * sex 	Sex 	
# * Age 	Age in years 	
# * sibsp 	# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic 	
# * parch 	# of parents / children aboard the Titanic 	
# * ticket 	Ticket number 	
# * fare 	Passenger fare 	
# * cabin 	Cabin number 	
# * embarked 	Port of Embarkation 	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
# 
# ### Variable Notes
# 
# * pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
#  - 1st = Upper
#  - 2nd = Middle
#  - 3rd = Lower
# 
# * age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
# 
# * sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
#     Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
#     Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
# 
# * parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
#     Parent = mother, father
#     Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
#     Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.

# **Bayesian network** is a special case of graphical Models. Graphical models solve the problem of defining the joint probability distribution, which is is difficult and requires a huge number of parameters.
# 
# In particular, Bayesian Networks present the following properties: 
#  * The independence assumptions made in a BN allows to avoid specifying the joint distributions. 
#  * A BN is a directed acyclic graph, and it allows a compact and modular representation of the joint probability distribution (probabilities at vertices are the local probability models). It allows to observe the conditional independence.
#  * In general, each variable X in the model is associated with a conditional probability distribution (CPD) that specifies a distribution over the values of X for each possible joint assignment of its parents in the model (local distributions). For a node with no parents, the CPD is conditioned on the empty set of variables, and can be seen as a marginal distribution (or prior).
#  * A BN consist of a structure and the CPDs. The chain rule for BN allows to express the joint distributions as a product of CPDs <br\>
#  => P(X1 , X2 , ... , Xn ) = Product_i  P(X_i | Parents( X_i )). 

# ### Libpgm library
# 
# The library reads the network information (nodes, edges, and CPD probabilities) from a JSON-formatted
# file with a specific format. This JSON file is read into
# * NodeData 
# * GraphSkeleton

# The TableCPDFactorization object wraps the discrete Bayesian network and allows us to query the CPDs in the network.
# 
# To make queries: use 
# > table_cpd=getTableCPD() <br\>
# > table_cpd.specificquery(dict(Offer='1'),dict(Grades='0'))
# 
# In BN parlance, the first argument is the "query" whilst the second corresponds to the "evidence".

chi ‚Äì The result of the chi-squared test on the data (compare the actual and the expected distri of X and Y given U). The expected distribution is P(X,Y,U)=P(U)P(X|U)P(Y|U). The Chi squared is a measure of the deviance between two distributions.  
    
pval ‚Äì The p-value of the test, meaning the probability of attaining a chi-square result as extreme as or more extreme than the one found, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. (e.g., a p-value of .05 means that if X and Y were independent given U, the chance of getting a chi-squared result this high or higher are .05). The Null H (independence) is rejected if the p-value is smaller than 0.05.

U ‚Äì The ‚Äòwitness‚Äô of X and Y‚Äôs independence. This is the variable that, when it is known, leaves X and Y independent.

Recall: conditional independence means: P(X|Y,Z) = P(X|Z) in this case X and Y are independent given Z. 
# # Random Notes

# 1. It is important to note another advantage of representing the joint distribution on a network: modularity.
# When you add a new variable G, the joint distribution changes entirely. Had we used the
# explicit representation of the joint, we would have had to write down twelve new numbers. In
# the factored representation, we could reuse our local probability models for the variables I and
# S, and specify only the probability model for G ‚Äî the CPD P (G | I). This property will turn
# out to be invaluable in modeling real-world systems.
# 
# 2. Bayesian networks build on the same intuitions as the naive Bayes model by exploiting con-
# ditional independence properties of the distribution in order to allow a compact and natural
# representation. However, they are not restricted to representing distributions satisfying the
# strong independence assumptions implicit in the naive Bayes model. They allow us the flexibil-
# ity to tailor our representation of the distribution to the independence properties that appear
# reasonable in the current setting.
# 
# 3. The core of the Bayesian network representation is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G, whose
# nodes are the random variables in our domain and whose edges correspond, intuitively, to direct
# influence of one node on another.This graph G can be viewed in two very different ways:
# ‚Ä¢ as a data structure that provides the skeleton for representing a joint distribution
# compactly in a factorized way;as a compact representation for a set of conditional independence assumptions about
# a distribution.
# 
# 4. Other librairies are: 
#     * BNFinder: a lib for identification of optimal BN, fast and efficient (cross validations and ROC curves included)
