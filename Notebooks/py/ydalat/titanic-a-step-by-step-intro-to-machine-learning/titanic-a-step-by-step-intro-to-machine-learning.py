# # 1. Introduction - Loading libraries and dataset
# I created this Python notebook as the learning notes of my first Machine Learning project.
# So many new terms, new functions, new approaches, but the subject really interested me; so I dived into it, studied one line of code at a time, and captured the references and explanations in this notebook.
# 
# The algorithm itself is a fork from **Anisotropic's Introduction to Ensembling/Stacking in Python**, a great notebook in itself.
# His notebook was itself based on **Faron's "Stacking Starter"**, as well as **Sina's Best Working Classfier**. 
# I also used multiple functions from **Yassine Ghouzam**.
# I added many variations and additional features to improve the code (as much as I could) as well as additional visualization.
# 
# Some key take away from my personal experiments and what-if analysis over the last couple of weeks:
# 
# * **The engineering of the right features is absolutely key**. The goal there is to create the right categories between survived and not survived. They do not have to be the same size or equally distributed. What helped best is to group together passengers with the same survival rates.
# 
# * ** I tried many, many different algorightms. Many overfit the training data** (up to 90%) but do not generate more accurate predictions with the test data. What worked better is to use the cross-validation on selected algotirhms. It is OK to select algorithms with various results as there is strenght in diversity. 
# 
# * **Lastly, the right ensembling was best achieved** with a votingclassifier with soft voting parameter
# 
# One last word: please use this kernel as a first project to practice your ML/Python skills. I shameless ley sotle and learnt from many Kagglers through my learning process, please do the same with the code in this kernel.
# 
# I also welcome your comments, questions and feedback.

# This is only a quick of the relationships between features before we start a more detailed analysis.
# 
# 
# # 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Cleaning and Engineering features
# 
# We will start with a standard approach of any kernel: correct, complete, engineer the right features for analysis.
# 
# ## 2.1. Correcting and completing features
# ### Detecting and correcting outliers
# Reviewing the data, there does not appear to be any aberrant or non-acceptable data inputs.
# 
# There are potential outliers that we will identify (steps from Yassine Ghouzam):
# * It creates firset a function called detect_outliers, implementing the Tukey method
# * For each column of the dataframe, this function calculates the 25th percentile (Q1) and 75th percentile (Q3) values.
# * The  interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles.
# * Any data points outside 1.5 time the IQR (1.5 time IQR below Q1, or 1.5 time IQR above Q3), is considered an outlier.
# * The outlier_list_col column captures the indices of these outliers. All outlier data get then pulled into the outlier_indices dataframe.
# * Finally, the detect_outliers function will select only the outliers happening multiple times. This is the datadframe that will be returned.

# In[ ]:


# Outlier detection 
def detect_outliers(df,n,features):
    outlier_indices = []
    # iterate over features(columns)
    for col in features:
        # 1st quartile (25%)
        Q1 = np.percentile(df[col],25)
        # 3rd quartile (75%)
        Q3 = np.percentile(df[col],75)
        # Interquartile range (IQR)
        IQR = Q3 - Q1
        # outlier step
        outlier_step = 1.5 * IQR
        # Determine a list of indices of outliers for feature col
        outlier_list_col = df[(df[col] < Q1 - outlier_step) | (df[col] > Q3 + outlier_step )].index       
        # append the found outlier indices for col to the list of outlier indices 
        outlier_indices.extend(outlier_list_col)
        
    # select observations containing more than 2 outliers
    outlier_indices = Counter(outlier_indices)        
    multiple_outliers = list( k for k, v in outlier_indices.items() if v > n )
    return multiple_outliers   
# detect outliers from Age, SibSp , Parch and Fare
Outliers_to_drop = detect_outliers(train,2,["Age","SibSp","Parch","Fare"])
train.loc[Outliers_to_drop] # Show the outliers rows


# ** Observations**
# * The Detect_Outliers function found 10 outliers.
# * PassengerID 28, 89 and 342 passenger have an high Ticket Fare
# * The seven others have very high values of SibSP.
# * I found that dropping the outliers actually lower the prediction. So I decided to keep them.
# 
# You can try to remove them and rerun the prediction to observe the result with the following function:

# In[ ]:


# Drop outliers
# train = train.drop(Outliers_to_drop, axis = 0).reset_index(drop=True)


# ### Completing features
# The .info function below shows how complete or incomplete the datasets are.
# There are null values or missing data in the age, cabin, and embarked field. Missing values can be bad, because some algorithms don't know how-to handle null values and will fail. While others, like decision trees, can handle null values.
# 
# The approach to to complete missing data is to impute using mean, median, or mean + randomized standard deviation. 
# We will do this in section 2.2 with the  **fillna** function:  dataset['Fare'] = dataset['Fare'].fillna(train['Fare'].median())

# There are multiple types of data
# 
# **a) Qualitative data: discrete**
# * Nominal: no natural order between categories. In this case: Name
# * Categorical: Sex
# 
# **b) Numeric or quantitative data**
# * Discrete: could be ordinal like Pclass or not like Survived.
# * Continuous. e.g.: age
# Many feature engineering steps were taken from Anisotropic's excellent kernel.

# * Only 38% survived, a real tragedy :-(
# * Passengers in more expensive classes 1 and 2 had much higher chance of surviving than classes 3 or 4.

# * Interesting is that accompanied women without a cabin had less survival chance than women alone without cabin.
#     But this is not true for men. Men alone have less chance than accompanied.
#     
#     **Bottom-line: it would have been better for women without cabin to pretend that they were alone.
#     And lone men should join a family to improve their survival rates.**

# ## 3.2. Dropping features
# Bottom-line of the bi-variate and tri-variate analysis as well as the feature importance analysis (from running the classifiers multiple times), **I decided to drop less-relevant features**. This happened as an iterative process by reviwing the outcome of the feature importance graph in the next section.
# The problem with less important features is that they create more noice and actually take over the importance of real features like Sex and Pclass.
# 
# **The next step after dropping less-relevant features is to scale them, a very good recommendation from Konstantin's kernel**
# It helps to boost the score. Scaling features is helpful for many ML algorithms like KNN for example, it really boosts their score.
# Feature scaling is a method used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In data processing, it is also known as data normalization.
# Feature standardization makes the values of each feature in the data have zero-mean (when subtracting the mean in the numerator) and unit-variance.
# The general method of calculation is to determine the distribution mean and standard deviation for each feature. Next we subtract the mean from each feature. Then we divide the values (mean is already subtracted) of each feature by its standard deviation.

# **Observations from the Pearson analysis:** 
# * Correlation coefficients with magnitude between 0.5 and 0.7 indicate variables which can be considered **moderately correlated**.
# * We can see from the red cells that many features are "moderately" correlated: specifically, IsAlone, Pclass, Name_length, Fare, Sex.
# * This is influenced by the following two factors: 1) Women versus men (and the compounding effect of Name_length) and 2) Passengers paying a high price (Fare) have a higher chance of survival: there are also in first class, have a title. 
# 
# 
# ## 3.4. Pairplots

# **Observations**
# * The pairplot graph all trivariate analysis into one figure.
# * The clustering of red dots indicates the combination of two features results in higher survival rates, or the opposite (clustering of blue dots = lower survival)
# For example:
# - Smaller family sizes in first and second class
# - Middle age with Pclass in third category = only blue dot

# But it shows how each classifier algorithm partitions the same data in different ways.
# The three rows represent the three different data set on the right.
# The plots show training points in solid colors and testing points semi-transparent. The lower right shows the classification accuracy on the test set.

# **Observations**
# * The above models (classifiers) were applied to a split training and x_test datasets.
# * This results in some classifiers (Decision_tree and Random_Forest) over-fitting the model to the training data. 
# * This happens when the classifiers use many input features (to include noise in each feature) on the complete dataset, and ends up “memorizing the noise” instead of finding the signal.
# * This overfit model will then make predictions based on that noise. It performs unusually well on its training data, but will not necessarilyimprove the prediction quality with new data from the test dataset.
# * In the next section, we will cross-validate the models using sample data against each others. We will this by using StratifiedKFold to train and test the models on sample data from the overall dataset.
# Stratified K-Folds is a cross validation iterator. It provides train/test indices to split data in train test sets. This cross-validation object is a variation of KFold, which returns stratified folds. The folds are made by preserving the percentage of samples for each class.

# ## 4.11. Model cross-validation with K-Fold
# 
# The fitting process applied above optimizes the model parameters to make the model fit the training data as well as possible.
# Cross-validation is a way to predict the fit of a model to a hypothetical validation set when an explicit validation set is not available.
# In simple words, it allows to test how well the model performs on new data.
# In our case, cross-validation will also be applied to compare the performances of different predictive modeling procedures.

# ## 4.12 Hyperparameter tuning & learning curves for selected classifiers
# 
# **1. Adaboost** is used in conjunction with many other types of learning algorithms to improve performance. The output of the other learning algorithms ('weak learners') is combined into a weighted sum that represents the final output of the boosted classifier. AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent weak learners are tweaked in favor of those instances misclassified by previous classifiers. AdaBoost is sensitive to noisy data and outliers.
# 
# **2. ExtraTrees** implements a meta estimator that fits a number of randomized decision trees (a.k.a. extra-trees) on various sub-samples of the dataset and use averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
# 
# **3. RandomForest ** operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.
# 
# **4. GradientBoost ** produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.
# 
# **5. SVMC, or Support Vector Machines.**vGiven a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.

# **Observations to fine-tune our models**
# 
# First, let's compare their best score after fine-tuning their parameters:
# 1. Adaboost: 80
# 2. ExtraTrees: 83
# 3. RandomForest: 82
# 4. GradientBoost: 82
# 5. SVC: 83
# 
# It appears that GBC and SVMC are doing the best job on the Train data. This is good because we want to keep the model as close to the training data as possible. But not too close!
# The two major sources of error are bias and variance; as we reduce these two, then we could build more accurate models:
# 
# * **Bias**: The less biased a method, the greater its ability to fit data well.
# * **Variance**: with a lower bias comes typically a higher the variance. And therefore the risk that the model will not adapt accurately to new test data.
# This is the case here with Gradient Boost: high score but cross-validation is very distant.
# 
# The reverse also holds: the greater the bias, the lower the variance. A high-bias method builds simplistic models that generally don't fit well training data. 
# We can see the red and green curves from ExtraTrees, RandomForest and SVC are pretty close.
# **This points to a lower variance, i.e. a stronger ability to apply the model to new data.**
# 
# I used the above graphs to optimize the parameters for Adaboost, ExtraTrees, RandomForest, GradientBoost and SVC.
# This resulted in a significant improvement of the prediction accuracy on the test data (score).
# 
# In addition, I found out that AdaBoost does not do a good job with this dataset as the training score and cross-validation score are quite far apart. 
# 
# ## 4.13 Selecting and combining the best classifiers
# So, how do we achieve the best trade-off beween bias and variance?
# 1. We will first compare in the next section the classifiers; results between themselves and applied to the same test data.
# 2. Then "ensemble" them together with an automatic function callled *voting*.

# * As indicated before, Adaboost has the lowest correlations when compared to other predictors. This indicates that it predicts differently than the others when it comes to the test data.

# Nice graphics, but the obsevation is unclear in my opinion:
# * On one side, we hope as analyst that the models come out with similar patterns. An easy direction to follow.
# * At the same time, "there have been quite a few articles and Kaggle competition winner stories about the merits of having trained models that are more uncorrelated with one another producing better scores". As we say in business, diversity brings better results, this seems to be true with algorithms as well!

# # 5. Producing the submission file for Kaggle
# 
# Finally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition.
# Which model to choose? These are the results of my many submissions:
# 
# **Submission 1: **The prediction with **KNeighborsClassifier KNN in Section 4.3.** generates a public score of **0.75119**.
# 
# **Submission 2:** The prediction with **random_forest in Section 4.9** generates a public score of **0.73684**.
# 
# **Submission 3 (Kaggle Version 85):** The prediction with **gsrandom_forest in Section 4.14 ** after stratification and model cross validation, generates a public score of **0.80382**. 
# 
# Decision: submit #3 as best predictor
