\n![Figure 1](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/4787675-0735a211713f2463.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\nWe can see the opposite condition of male and female, **most of the males died and most of the females lived**.  \nFor children, it is nearly half and half.  \nWe can look at more details at bar tables.\n![Figure 2](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/4787675-1f5587a91e18d8c9.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\nIt exactly shows female have higher survival rate than male and children have higher survival rate than non-children.  \n\nWe can also use statistical hypothesis test confirm this.\nWe use Chi-Square-test, get Chi-Square Score and pvalue. These actually reject null hypothesis, and confirm our hypothesis in a high significance. \n\n### Second Question: Class factor with Survive rate\nAs above, we show violin plot first.  \nWe can see most of the 1st class survived, most of 3rd class died, and nearly half of 2nd class survived.  \n![Figure3](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/4787675-aee0b30d3878980a.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\nThen show people number of the three classes and respective survive rate.  \n![Figure4](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/4787675-fff2b05415b730e4.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\nIt seems higher class have higher survive rate, and 3rd class has most of the people, but lowest survive rate.  \n\nUsing Chi-Square-test analyse three class, It shows **Class actually relate to survive rate, especially between class 3 and upper classes**.\n\n### Third Question: Fare fator with Survive rate\nAt first, show people distribution of different fares.\n![Figure5](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/4787675-949cd2809835146c.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\nWe can see there are some outliners pay a lot of fare.  \nFor fair, we clean them out, and plot mean fare for survive and non-survive groups.\n![Figure6](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/4787675-7f2431e3c6f618f7.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\nIt shows clearly **people survived with higher fare.**  \nT-test also confirms our idea.\n\n### Forth Question: When going to each class and each sex, above conclusions still work?\nAt first, plot bar chart for each sex and coordinate class.  \nSome interesting things emerge out.  \n![Figure7](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/4787675-3246fc48cff7af1e.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\nFor male, its no longer higher class with higher survival rate, \n2nd class men even have lower survival rate than 3rd class men.  \nFor female and child, 1st class and 2nd class seems have similar survive rate.  \n\nTo confirm our observation, carry on Chi-Square-test between 1st and 2nd class female and child, and 2nd and 3rd class men.  \nIf we hold 99% significance, all the three null hypothesis can't be rejected.  \nTherefore, what we conclude above don't work here.  \n\n## Conclusion\n1. **Women have higher survival rate than men and children, no matter whole people or separate classes.**  \n2. **Children have higher survival rate than whole adult group.**  \n3. **From the whole view, higher class has higher survival rate.**  \n4. **Survived people have higher price of their fares.**  \n5. **If we look at details, some of above conclusions fail.**  \n  1. **For 1st and 2nd classes, women and children have similar survival rate.**\n  2. **For 2nd and 3rd classes, men have similar survival rate.**", "metadata": {"deletable": true, "editable": true, "_cell_guid": "1dab6748-f016-47f0-ae7a-092278b6d9d2", "_uuid": "66dcb3090a433a9d6757368a58bfa69ea03c582a"}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"source": "## Reference\n\n1.
