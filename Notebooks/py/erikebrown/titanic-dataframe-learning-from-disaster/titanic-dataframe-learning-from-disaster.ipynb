You can access any column as a `Series` using  brackets or as an attribute. The DataFrame converts an attribute name into a column automatically. So `training_df['Fare']` and `training_df.Fare` both return the Fare column. Column names are case-sensitive, so Pclass and pclass are not the same. So the passenger class column is accessible with `training.Pclass` or `training['Pclass']` but both `training.pclass` and `training.['pclass']` result in an error.\n\n### Column Exercises\nThese will make more sense if you try the following exercises:\n1. Another feature of pandas is to construct columns using the plus (+) operator. Use this to verify  that `training_df.Ticket` and `training_df['Ticket']` return the same series by adding these together, placing the string `' equals '` in between them.  That is, use the code `training_df.Ticket + ' equals ' + training_df['Ticket']` to see the two values side by side.\n2. Previously we noticed that the Age column is a float type. Display this column to see that the values are indeed decimal values.\n3. Does the Cabin column have any null, or missing, values? Display this column to see.  Null values are shown as `NaN` in the list.\n4. What are the two values used in the Sex column?\n5. What happens if you enter an invalid name? Use both `training_df['pclass']` and `training_df.age` to see.

The `values` attribute we saw previously returns an array of row arrays. So `training_df.values[3]` will show the fourth row (remember, indexes start at 0). There are also two attributes `loc` and `iloc` that access specific locations within the table. The `iloc` attribute is purely integer based (`i` is for integer), while the `loc` attribute is index and column name based (or boolean values, but that is for another time).\n\nIf you look at the table, Age is the sixth column (index 5), so to obtain the Age of the fourth row (index 3) you can do this with any of the following:\n> `training_df.values[3][5]`   \n>  `training_df.iloc[3,5]`   \n>  `training_df.loc[3,'Age']`   \n\nIn the Titanic data the index is the same as the row number, so it isn't immediately clear in this example that the 3 used in `iloc` and `loc` and very different.  We'll see a better example of this in the exercises.\n\n### Row Execises\nThis may seem a little confusing, so work through the following exercises for a better understanding.\n1. Display the three Age values in the above example to verify that they all return the same value. If you want to be clever, write the three examples on the same line separated by commas. You will get a three-number tuple showing the three identical values.\n2. What does the `values` attribute look like without an index? To find out, evalute `training_df.values`to see the result.\n3.

There is an `all()` method that returns whether all elements are `True`.\n* `corr()` returns the pairwise correlation of numeric columns, excluding `NaN` values. A `corrwith()` method also exists to perform correlation against another DataFrame (or a column in the current DataFrame).\n* `describe()` returns statistics that summarize the shape of numerical columns.\n* `isnull()` returns a boolean same-sized DataFrame indicating which values are not defined (`NaN`)\n* `median()` returns the median value for each numeric column. Methods for `mean()`, `min()`, and `max()` also exist.\n* `sum()` adds (or concatenates, for strings) the columns or rows in the DataFrame.\n\n#### Analysis Methods Exercises\n1. Use the `any()` method with the DataFrame returned by `isnull()` to show which columns have null values in the training data.\n2. Which numeric column correlates most postively with the Survived column? Use the `corr()` method on the training set to view the correlations on the numeric columns in the training data, and then look at the Survived column or row to see the answer. A higher positive correlation means that higher column values translate to higher survival chances. Does this make sense?\n3. The `corrwith()` method makes the prior question 2 even easier, as it takes the target for comparison. Call `corrwith()` using the Survived column as the parameter (`training_df.Survived`) to view correlations against the Survived column.\n1. Using the answer for question 3, what column most negatively correlates with survival? A negative correlation means that lower column values translate to higher survival chances. Does this make sense?\n5. What are two ways to find the median value for the Age column? (hint: finding the 50% value using the `describe()` method is one of them).\n6. Methods that result in a list, or Series, also accept a column name as an attribute to show that column's value. For example, `training_df.mean().Fare` will return the mean value for just the Fare column.  Use this feature to find  the difference between the median and mean value for the `Fare` column, writing your answer as a single expression.\n1. What is the difference in Ages between the oldest and youngest passenger?\n1. Is the median Age in the training set nearer in years to the youngest passenger or the oldest passenger?\n7. How many passengers in the training set survived?

Create a copy of the training set called `mydata` and call `mydata.shape` to verify it has the same size as the original set. Use this copy for the subsequent exercises.\n2. Which removes more data from the `mydata` table, dropping rows with null values or columns with null values? Use `dropna()` to drop each axis in turn, as in the example, and use the `shape` or `size` attribute to determine which resulting table has more values.\n1. Another way to handle null values is fill them with another value, using the `fillna()` method. Fill null values in the `mydata` table with 0 (zero) in place and then execute `mydata.isnull().any()` to verify there are no null values left in the table.\n1. Refresh `mydata` with a fresh copy of the training set. Many DataFrame methods, including `fillna()`, can be invoked on a single column, as in `training_df.Fare.fillna(42)` to fill missing Fare values with 42. Fill the null values in the Age column for `mydata` (in place) to its median value.\n1. Using the modified Age column in `mydata` from the prior question, set the minimum and maximum Age in the mydata table to 5 and 75, respectively (hint: use `clip()` and pass the lower and upper values). Use the `describe()` method to verify the result.\n1. One standard use of `clip()` is to eliminate outliers that might otherwise skew the data. Look at the median and max value for the Fare column and you will see a rather large descrepancy. Modify the `mydata` table (in place) so the maximum value for the Fare column is 100 (hint: use the `clip_upper()` method on `mydata.Fare`). Show the `mean()` for the Fare column in both `mydata` and `training_df` to see the difference.\n1. Create a filtered table from the training set including only the PassengerId, Fair, and Age columns.

What is the minimum, maximum, and median value for this new column?\n1. Make a copy of the training set called `mydata`.

This method saves the DataFrame into a csv file in the given path. Methods for saving as Excel, HTML, json and many other formats also exist. \n* `to_pickle(path)` serializes a DataFrame into the given path as a [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) object.\n\nThe `to_` methods are fairly self-explanatory. These methods accept the file location where the output should be written. We mention `pickle` here as this is a good way to transfer objects between environments. The `to_pickle()` method outputs a pickled object, which can then be read into another enviornment using the `read_pickle()` method.\n\nThe `plot()` method uses the 2D plotting package matplotlib to create graphs of the data.  A large number of parameters control what kind of plot to create, including `kind` for the kind of chart (bar, pie, scatter, and others), `x` and `y` for what to  show on each axis,  and `title` to set the chart title. A full discussion is beyond the scope of this discussion, but here are some examplse that show how this method works. The comment before each example is meant to illustrate the type of question the subsequent plot might answer.\n> `# View passenger age clusters for survived passengers (alpha sets transparency)`   \n> `training_df.plot(x='Age',y='Survived',kind='scatter', alpha=0.1)`    \n>\n> `# What is the median of each numeric column among survivors`   \n> `# Note that removing PassengerID from the table makes our chart more readable`   \n> `training_df.drop('PassengerId',axis='columns').median().plot(x='Survived',kind='bar')`   \n> \n> `# What is the distribution of Fares among the passengers`   \n> `training_df.plot(y='Fare',kind='hist', title=\"Passenger Counts by Fare Groupings\")`   \n> \n> `# Display the average fare by passenger class`   \n> `training_df.groupby('Pclass').mean().plot(y='Fare', title=\"Average Fare by Class\")`   \n\nFeel free to try these and other parameters for the `plot()` method. More detailed documentation for this method can be found [in the pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e4df249bb34a50532280b5b6c0b1eb56a6a18c25"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Try the plot() examples here\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"13c35f57ca098ac372fbc026786f17c982021735"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusion\nThat is an overview of the DataFrame class.
