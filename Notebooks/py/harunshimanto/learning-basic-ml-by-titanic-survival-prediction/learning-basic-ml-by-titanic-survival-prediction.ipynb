There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. The Titanic was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, her architect, died in the disaster.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/l8lxGPm.jpg)\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a5d315e28b0ddaf6238047ae38504587d8b83654"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# &#128250; Short Video on RMS Titanic"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1b8c54ea0208077095ae3cca68a6ae24889dacaf"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import YouTubeVideo\nYouTubeVideo('9xoqXVjBEF8')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a32c3653e1beee4e6e6a2c59b43a1949030920cf"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# &#128209; About the Titanic Problem:\nUsing the machine learning tools, we need to analyze the information about the passensgers of RMS Titanic and predict which passenger has survived.

New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Suppose some given data points each belong to one of two classes, and the goal is to decide which class a new data point will be in.

Gaussian Naive Bayes\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HyPUqwF.png)\nNaive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.\n\nBayes' theorem (alternatively Bayes' law or Bayes' rule) describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. For example, if cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes' theorem, a person's age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer, compared to the assessment of the probability of cancer made without knowledge of the person's age.\n\nNaive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set. It is not a single algorithm for training such classifiers, but a family of algorithms based on a common principle: all naive Bayes classifiers assume that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 10 cm in diameter. A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to contribute independently to the probability that this fruit is an apple, regardless of any possible correlations between the color, roundness, and diameter features."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c0d44dfd2a4f3e4acfc34185a87cdc640b672e88"},"cell_type":"code","source":"clf = GaussianNB()\nclf.fit(X_train, Y_train)\ny_pred_gnb = clf.predict(X_test)\nacc_gnb = round(clf.score(X_train, Y_train) * 100, 2)\nprint (str(acc_gnb) + '%')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"23df7259385ab303806d729006e76860d95ef088"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 9.Confusion Matrix \n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HyPUqwF.png)\n\n\nA [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix), also known as an error matrix, is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class while each column represents the instances in an actual class (or vice versa). The name stems from the fact that it makes it easy to see if the system is confusing two classes (i.e. commonly mislabelling one as another).\n\nIn predictive analytics, a table of confusion (sometimes also called a confusion matrix), is a table with two rows and two columns that reports the number of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives. This allows more detailed analysis than mere proportion of correct classifications (accuracy). Accuracy is not a reliable metric for the real performance of a classifier, because it will yield misleading results if the data set is unbalanced (that is, when the numbers of observations in different classes vary greatly). For example, if there were 95 cats and only 5 dogs in the data set, a particular classifier might classify all the observations as cats. The overall accuracy would be 95%, but in more detail the classifier would have a 100% recognition rate for the cat class but a 0% recognition rate for the dog class.\n\nHere's another guide explaining [Confusion Matrix with example](http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/).\n\n$\\begin{matrix} & Predicted Positive & Predicted Negative \\\\ Actual Positive & TP & FN \\\\ Actual Negative & FP & TN \\end{matrix}$\n\nIn our (Titanic problem) case: \n\n>**True Positive:** The classifier predicted *Survived* **and** the passenger actually *Survived*.\n>\n>**True Negative:** The classifier predicted *Not Survived* **and** the passenger actually *Not Survived*.\n>\n>**False Postiive:** The classifier predicted *Survived* **but** the passenger actually *Not Survived*.\n>\n>**False Negative:** The classifier predicted *Not Survived* **but** the passenger actually *Survived*.\n"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"52a465270cc71be73961e087546ff038cdee796a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()\nclf.fit(X_train, Y_train)\ny_pred_decision_tree_training_set = clf.predict(X_train)\nacc_decision_tree = round(clf.score(X_train, Y_train) * 100, 2)\nprint (\"Accuracy: %i %% \\n\"%acc_decision_tree)\n\nclass_names = ['Survived', 'Not Survived']\n\n# Compute confusion matrix\ncnf_matrix = confusion_matrix(Y_train, y_pred_decision_tree_training_set)\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=2)\n\nprint ('Confusion Matrix in Numbers')\nprint (cnf_matrix)\nprint ('')\n\ncnf_matrix_percent = cnf_matrix.astype('float') / cnf_matrix.sum(axis=1)[:, np.newaxis]\n\nprint ('Confusion Matrix in Percentage')\nprint (cnf_matrix_percent)\nprint ('')\n\ntrue_class_names = ['True Survived', 'True Not Survived']\npredicted_class_names = ['Predicted Survived', 'Predicted Not Survived']\n\ndf_cnf_matrix = pd.DataFrame(cnf_matrix, \n                             index = true_class_names,\n                             columns = predicted_class_names)\n\ndf_cnf_matrix_percent = pd.DataFrame(cnf_matrix_percent, \n                                     index = true_class_names,\n                                     columns = predicted_class_names)\n\nplt.figure(figsize = (15,5))\n\nplt.subplot(121)\nsns.heatmap(df_cnf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d')\n\nplt.subplot(122)\nsns.heatmap(df_cnf_matrix_percent, annot=True)\nplt.xkcd()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0a155596c71e76c7c09f71c147716545d11e6ca4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Comparing Models\n\nLet's compare the accuracy score of all the classifier models used above."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2524819dd174111eef74f67451996c2bdb84902b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"models = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Model': ['Logistic Regression', 'Support Vector Machines', 'Linear SVC', \n              'KNN', 'Decision Tree', 'Random Forest', 'Naive Bayes', 'Stochastic Gradient Decent'],\n    \n    'Score': [acc_log_reg, acc_svc, acc_linear_svc, \n              acc_knn,  acc_decision_tree, acc_random_forest, acc_gnb, acc_sgd]\n    })\n\nmodels.sort_values(by='Score', ascending=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f1955cfc4fd2a6f5ad4390fc97e4f8216e4f9ee3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the above table, we can see that *Decision Tree* and *Support Vector Machines* classfiers have the highest accuracy score.\n\nAmong these two, we choose *Support Vector Machines* classifier as it has the ability to limit overfitting as compared to *Decision Tree* classifier."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3ed27b0dbb2a7c2237456ebf9dda028cbb627439"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Create Submission File to Kaggle\n"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"abebab70862458cd58618f90e3692f56a42dc5f5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"test.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"faa083c049df4415084dab059a53398e28488b77","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"submission = pd.DataFrame({\n        \"PassengerId\": test[\"PassengerId\"],\n        \"Survived\": Y_prediction_randomforest \n    })\nsubmission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"795bad0bef2e1884f389d819536debd1b4587c6c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# References\nThis notebook is created by learning from the following notebooks:\n\n1.[Predicting the Survival of Titanic Passengers](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-the-survival-of-titanic-passengers-30870ccc7e8)\n\n2.[A Journey through Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/omarelgabry/a-journey-through-titanic)\n\n3.[Introduction to machine learning in Python with scikit-learn](https://www.dataschool.io/machine-learning-with-scikit-learn/)\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6fdd5d8de91f8e5b96590bc62562a0542b9c48d7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# &#128225;
