This is a dataset from a beginner's competition on Kaggle.\n\nThis dataset holds attributes about passengers on the Titanic (such as age, sex, fare price, etc.) along with whether they survived. In this kernel, we will build a model to predict whether a given passenger survived based on their attributes. For example, given a passenger with who is 18 years old, male, and bought a $50 ticket, our model should predict whether he survived or not. \n\n## Initial Assessment of the Dataset\n### Importing the dataset\nTo import our data, we use a python package called ```pandas```.  Note that we have two datasets: training data (```train_df```) and testing data (```test_df```). In supervised learning, we usually build our models from the training data and analyze our model's accuracy using the testing data. Both datasets contain a list of passengers, except they are mutually exclusive."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Import csv data as DataFrame objects.\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv');\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a52d5ac1aafba83c579b7ba3b505af343e3bb68a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In Python, variable types are not explicitly declared in our code.
