Translated 32% survival rate.\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\n## Workflow goals\n\n**Classifying.** Classify or categorize our samples. \n\n**Correlating.**  Correlating certain features to help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\n\n**Converting.** Convert data, encode, one-hot encoding, etc.\n\n**Completing.** Estimate values where needed.\n\n**Correcting.** Correct data or discard not usable data.\n\n**Creating.** Create new features.\n\n**Charting.** Plot and graphs.
