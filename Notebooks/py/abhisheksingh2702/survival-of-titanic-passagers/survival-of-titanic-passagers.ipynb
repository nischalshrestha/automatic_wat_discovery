On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. \nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck lead to such loss of life is that were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.  Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, like women, children, and the upper-class.\nIn this analysis I will try to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.  \n\nVARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:\n\npclass          Passenger Class\n                (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)\n                \nsurvival        Survival\n                (0 = No; 1 = Yes)\n                \nname            Name\n\nsex             \n\nage             Age\n\nsibsp           Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard\n\nparch           Number of Parents/Children Aboard\n\nticket          Ticket Number\n\nfare            Passenger Fare\n\ncabin           Cabin\n\nembarked        Port of Embarkation\n                (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)\n                \nhome.dest       Home/Destination\n\nSPECIAL NOTES:\nPclass is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES\n 1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8565815f357a7109aaa41f58bd37ddd7d996ba7e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**1.
