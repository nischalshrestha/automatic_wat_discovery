# # Visualization of titanic dataset
# This notebook presents a profound exploratory analysis of the dataset in order to demonstrate different visualization techniques as well as provide understanding of the dependencies and interesting facts. 
# 
# 
# Four ML techniques are used to do prediction: RandomForest, LogisticRegression, KNeighbours and the Ensemble.
# 
# Logistic Regression performed the best with a score of 0.799.
# 
# 
# UPDATE1: XGBoost was added
# 
# UPDATE2: The calculation of the values to be imputed should ONLY be done on train set and not on test set or both.

# #### A citate from a movie: 'Children and women first'. 
# * Sex: Survival chances of women are higher.
# * Pclass: Having a first class ticket is beneficial for the survival.
# * SibSp and Parch: middle size families had higher survival rate than the people who travelled alone or big families. The reasoning might be that alone people would want to sacrifice themselves to help others. Regarding the big families I would explain that it is hard to manage the whole family and therefore people would search for the family members insetad of getting on the boat.
# * Embarked C has a higher survival rate. It would be interesting to see if, for instance, the majority of Pclass 1 went on board in embarked C.

# * Survival rate of boys is higher than of the adult men. However, the same fact does not hold for the girls. and between 13 and 30 is lower. Take it into consideration while engineering the variable: we could specify a categorical variable as young and adult.
# * For women the survival chances are higher between 14 and 40 age. For men of the same age the survival chances are flipped.

# ## 1.3 Survival by Class,  Embarked and Fare.

# ## 1.3.1 Survival by Class and Embarked

# * As noticed already before, the class 1 passangers had a higher survival rate.
# * All women who died were from the 3rd class. 
# * Embarked in Q as a 3rd class gave you slighly better survival chances than embarked in S for the same class.
# * In fact, there is a very high variation in survival rate in embarked Q among 1st and 2nd class. The third class had the same survival rate as the 3rd class embarked C. We will exclude this variable embarked Q. From crosstab we see that there were only 5 passengers in embarked Q with the 1st and 2nd class. That explains large variation in survival rate and a perfect separation of men and women in Q.

# ## 1.3.2 Fare and class distribution

# In[ ]:


ax = sns.boxplot(x="Pclass", y="Fare", hue="Survived", data=train)
ax.set_yscale('log')


# * It appears that the higher the fare was in the first class the higher survival chances a person from the 1st had.

# ## 1.3.3 Class and age distribution

# In[ ]:


sns.violinplot(x='Pclass', y='Age', hue='Survived', data=train, split=True);


# * Interesting note that Age decreases proportionally with the Pclass, meaning most old passangers are from 1st class. We will construct a new feature Age*Class to intefere the this findig. 
# * The younger people from 1st had higher survival chanches than older from the same class.
# * Majority (from the 3rd class) and most children from the 2nd class survived.

# ## 1.4 Survival rate regarding the family members

# In[ ]:


# To get the full family size of a person, added siblings and parch.
train['family_size'] = train['SibSp'] + train['Parch'] + 1

# Assumption: the less people was in your family the faster you were to get to the boat. The more people they are the more managment is required. However, if you had no family members you might wanted to help others and therefore sacrifice.
# 
# * The females traveling with up to 2 more family members had a higher chance to survive. However, a high variation of survival rate appears once family size exceeds 4 as mothers/daughters would search longer for the members and therefore the chanes for survival decrease.
# * Alone men might want to sacrifice and help other people to survive. 

# ## 1.5 Survival rate by the title
# * Barplots show that roalties had normally 1st or 2nd class tickets. However, people with the title Master had mostly 3rd class. In fact, a title 'Master' was given to unmarried boys. You can see that the age of of people with this title is less than 13.
# * Women and roalties had higher survival rate. (There are only two titlted women in the train class and both have survived, I would put them into Mrs class)
# * The civils and reverends a lower one due to the fact that they had/wanted to help people.

# ## 1.7 Correlation of the variables
# * Pclass is slightly correlated with Fare as logically, 3rd class ticket would cost less than the 1st class.
# * Pclass is also slightly correlated with Survived
# * SibSp and Parch are weakly correlated as basically they show how big the family size is.

# ## 2. FEATURE SELECTION AND ENGINEERING
# ## 2.1 Impute values
# NB: The calculation of values to impute should only be done on train set. For example, you want to impute the mean of age in the mussing values in test set. The mean of age should only be calculated on train set to avoid data leakage.
# 
# First, we check how many nas there is in general. If there is only small amount then we can just exclude those individuals. Considering that there are 891 training samples, 708 do not have missing values. 183 samples have na values. It is better to impute. There are different techniques one can impute the values.
