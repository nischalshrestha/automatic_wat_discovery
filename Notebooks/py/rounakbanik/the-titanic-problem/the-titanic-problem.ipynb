Pandas makes it very easy to work with complex data with incredibly powerful data structures such as dataframes and series.\n", "* **Numpy:** The de facto scientific computing package. Many other libraries such as pandas and sklearn are based on numpy. Numpy gives us access to blistering fast mathematical calculations and makes linear algebra a breeze.\n", "* **Scipy:** The statistical package. Contains an immense number of statistical tools that makes inferential statistical analysis extremely easy. \n", "* **Scikit-learn:** The machine learning package of Python. Makes implementing ML Algorithms extremely simple. The package has implementations of all the major classifiers and regressors and makes it incredibly simple to switch between different models.\n", "* **Matplotlib:** The data visualisation package of Python. While not as powerful as the packages available in R, it still packs enough power to perform almost every visualisation you could possibly have a need for.\n", "* **Seaborn:** While working with matplotlib, you will eventually realize that implementing a few things become a real pain and the default graphics are rather dull.
