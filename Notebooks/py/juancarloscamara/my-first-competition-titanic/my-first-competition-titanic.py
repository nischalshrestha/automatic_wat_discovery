# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# From the previous fields we see some things:
# - Cabin field is almost emptied in both files, train and test
# - Age field has Not valid values in both files, train and test, for some of the records
# - Fare is a field that potentially does not make sense to be related with the possibility of surviving or not - correlation necessary
# - Ticket is a field that potentially does not make sense to be related with the possibility of surviving or not - correlation necessary. However, not empty fields. We´ll keept it
# - Embarked is a field that potentially does not make sense to be related with the possibility of surviving or not - correlation necessary
# - Name is a field that could be divided and analyzed, but right now does not make sense to be related with survival
# - Sex is a field that make sense to analyzed, but it´s string. Conversion is necessary
