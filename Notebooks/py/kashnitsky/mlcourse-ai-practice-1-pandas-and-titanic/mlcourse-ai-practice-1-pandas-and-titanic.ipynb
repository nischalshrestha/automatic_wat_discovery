[ods.ai](http://ods.ai)). It's distinctive features are:\n - Perfect balance between theory and practice\n - Quick dive into Kaggle competitions (some assignments require beating baselines)\n - Highly motivating rating held during the course\n - Materials as [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/mlcourse/kernels)\n - And much more, check the course [roadmap](https://mlcourse.ai/roadmap) \n \nHere we present a simplified version of an assignment on Pandas and preliminary data analysis. Prior to completing the assignment, you might address the 1st part of the course material [\"Topic 1. Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas\"](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-1-exploratory-data-analysis-with-pandas) and/or watch the [1st lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwWCw_cE5aI). Solution to this practice can be found in mlcourse.ai  [Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/mlcourse/kernels).\n \n PS. If it looks too simple for you, take a look at course [assignments](https://mlcourse.ai/assignments)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9f22f6db1c10c7a7b6d0ca92fa1353273eb60cf1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <center> Topic 1.
