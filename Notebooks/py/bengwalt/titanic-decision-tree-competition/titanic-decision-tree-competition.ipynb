The goal of their learning algorithms is always to find the best split for each node of the tree.

The sklearn library we're gonna use implements Gini Impurity, another common measure, so let’s explain it.\n\nGini Impurity measures the disorder of a set of elements. It is calculated as the probability of mislabelling an element assuming that the element is randomly labelled according to the distribution of all the classes in the set.

This is a critical point for every Data Science project, since too much train data can easily result in bad model generalisation (accuracy on test/real/unseen observations). Over-fitting (a model excessively adapted to the train data) is a common reason. In other cases, too much data can also hide meaningful relationships either because they evolve with time or because highly correlated features prevent the model from capturing properly the value of each single one.\n\nIn the case of decision trees, the 'max_depth' parameter determines the maximum number of attributes the model is going to use for each prediction (up to the number of available features in the dataset). A good way to find the best value for this parameter is just iterating through all the possible depths and measure the accuracy with a robust method such as Cross Validation.\n\nCross Validation is a model validation technique that splits the training dataset in a given number of \"folds\". Each split uses different data for training and testing purposes, allowing the model to be trained and tested with different data each time. This allows the algorithm to be trained and tested with all available data across all folds, avoiding any splitting bias and giving a good idea of the generalisation of the chosen model. The main downside is that Cross Validation requires the model to be trained for each fold, so the computational cost can be very high for complex models or huge datasets."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"108bfca0bbd2e083ac22a64ba40e1d0b51bcd64f","scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cv = KFold(n_splits=10)            # Desired number of Cross Validation folds\naccuracies = list()\nmax_attributes = len(list(test))\ndepth_range = range(1, max_attributes + 1)\n\n# Testing max_depths from 1 to max attributes\n# Uncomment prints for details about each Cross Validation pass\nfor depth in depth_range:\n    fold_accuracy = []\n    tree_model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth = depth)\n    # print(\"Current max depth: \", depth, \"\\n\")\n    for train_fold, valid_fold in cv.split(train):\n        f_train = train.loc[train_fold] # Extract train data with cv indices\n        f_valid = train.loc[valid_fold] # Extract valid data with cv indices\n\n        model = tree_model.fit(X = f_train.drop(['Survived'], axis=1), \n                               y = f_train[\"Survived\"]) # We fit the model with the fold train data\n        valid_acc = model.score(X = f_valid.drop(['Survived'], axis=1), \n                                y = f_valid[\"Survived\"])# We calculate accuracy with the fold validation data\n        fold_accuracy.append(valid_acc)\n\n    avg = sum(fold_accuracy)/len(fold_accuracy)\n    accuracies.append(avg)\n    # print(\"Accuracy per fold: \", fold_accuracy, \"\\n\")\n    # print(\"Average accuracy: \", avg)\n    # print(\"\\n\")\n    \n# Just to show results conveniently\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"Max Depth\": depth_range, \"Average Accuracy\": accuracies})\ndf = df[[\"Max Depth\", \"Average Accuracy\"]]\nprint(df.to_string(index=False))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a8ccb3296f0f16cbe906b3b06e1ce965e5378382"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The best max_depth parameter seems therefore to be 3 (80.5% average accuracy across the 10 folds), and feeding the model with more data results in worse results probably due to over-fitting.
