I will first analyse the dataset using basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methods. \n2. After the initial analysys on the dataset, I will perform feature analysis and see what features are best that could be used in applying Machine Learning models.\n3. I will apply the various Machine Learning classification models. \n4. I will observe the classification results and see if hyperparameter tuning would help in improving the results."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7fa7aa13a48920611bdbfb91d868a79ff0ea1a46"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Step 1: EDA methods to analyse the dataset**\n\nWe will use Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib to do EDA.\n\nDetails of these libraries: \n\nNumpy: Numpy is a simple Python library that is used for performing operations on data in terms of arrays of objects.\n\nPandas: Pandas is a library used to read the data in a form of table having rows and columns. This library is very much useful in extracting the dataset in a tabular format which would be in a better readable form.\n\nMatplotlib: Matplotlib is Python library for making graphical plots. This library can be used with data in order to visually understand the relations among different attributes/columns in the dataset."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#reading the training data\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntraindataset = pd.DataFrame(train)\ntraindataset.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"4bf2bdf053913c2e82a09edbf9ea7cf20f621579"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
