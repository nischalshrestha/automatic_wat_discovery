Conclusions\n\n<p>After submission of these predictions, I received a test score of about 80%.</p>\n\n<p>Principal potential areas of improvement to our analysis would be outlier extraction, feature removal, and/or the addition of more models. There may be certain outliers (for example, during the analysis I noted that there are just 1 or 2 passengers over age 70, who are both 80 and both survived) which could be removed to make the model more generalizable. One could also experiment with removing some of the features, as there may be overlap (title and sex as an example may be essential the same feature). Finally, more advanced models (such as XGBoost) could be implemented or one could consider a voting classifier to include input from all models that were considered.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading my kernel! As I mentioned in the introduction, I know there is plenty of room for improvement and any feedback or comments are greatly appreciated. Good luck in your own projects!</p>"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
