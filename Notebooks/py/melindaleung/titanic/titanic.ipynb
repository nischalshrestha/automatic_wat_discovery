Ticket feature may be dropped from our analysis, because it contains a high ratio of duplicates (22%). Cabin feature may also be dropped as it contains many missing values. There may not be any correlation between these variables and survival.\n2. PassengerId may be dropped because it doesn't contribute to this dataset and is just an index.\n3. The unique names of the passenger themselves may not provide any predictive value, but their titles could potentially be used. Engineer a new variable called \"Title\" to extract the passenger's status.\n4. Parch and SibSp are closely related. It might be easier to create a new variable called \"Family\" to get the total count of family members on board.\n5. There are missing features in the Age variable. Age is definitely correlated with survival and missing values should be completed.\n6. Age and Fare may also benefit from a band or range feature.\n\nThe following assumptions are still valid:\n1. Women (Sex = female) were more likely to have survived.\n2. Children (Age < ?) were more likely to have survived.\n3. Upper-class passengers (Pclass = 1) were more likely to have survived.\n\n<a id='Data Preprocessing'></a>\n# 02.

Modeling\n\nThis is a binary classification and regression supervised learning problem. Therefore, I will fit the following models to my data:\n- **Logistic Regression**: Logistic regression measures the relationship between the target and features by estimating probabilities using a logistic function.\n- **KNN**: KNN is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. A sample is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the sample being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors. \n- **Support Vector Machines**: Given a set of training samples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new test samples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.\n- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. Naive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features) in a learning problem.\n- **Decision Tree**: Decision tree maps features (tree branches) to conclusions about the target value (tree leaves). \n- **Random Forest**: Random forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.\n- **Perceptron**: The perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers that bases its predictions on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. \n\n*Reference: Wikipedia*"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"2581f875669a6e134f293e918ec42dc6a156bf87"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, Perceptron\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom tqdm import tqdm","execution_count":39,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"58c5cb030c99d48065ec6aeafb49d5f11e8c4cd7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Train Test Split"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"f7ad81f369f8577d10d29361bc812c9c9da53559"},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train = train_cleaned.drop('Survived', axis=1) #Features\ny_train = train_cleaned['Survived'] #Target\nX_test  = test_cleaned.drop('Survived', axis=1)\nX_train.shape, y_train.shape, X_test.shape #Verify everything has the right dimensions","execution_count":40,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1a30e8a21e85012d98c813dd35bcb22fd7fce822"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Run Models\n\nI created a function to run all my models."},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"bff71fb0d3e4467cb03e8e17536436c037e24ec0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"models = {\n    'Logistic Regression' : LogisticRegression(),\n    'KNN' : KNeighborsClassifier(),\n    'SVM' : SVC(),\n    'Naive Bayes Classifier' : GaussianNB(),\n    'Decision Tree' : DecisionTreeClassifier(),\n    'Random Forest' : RandomForestClassifier(),\n    'Perceptron' : Perceptron()\n}","execution_count":41,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"c6483b9bc5bf79cbca8df01c7114461ba962b888"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def run_model(model, X_train, y_train, X_test):\n    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    model.predict(X_test)\n    return{\n        'Accuracy': round(model.score(X_train, y_train) * 100, 2)\n    }","execution_count":42,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"9861f7bcab4715c7a04de48e5af023ec0d7b11a0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"results = {}\nmodel_name = models.keys()\nfor name in tqdm(model_name):\n    results[name] = run_model(models[name], X_train, y_train, X_test)","execution_count":43,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"42c0c495630dc8222cb9265372188704c424ed69"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusions"},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"4d277e860236d0541a620bc98b99ef5ca41f4c88"},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.DataFrame(results).T.sort_values(by = 'Accuracy', ascending = False)","execution_count":44,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2893ad548fbe2335ad7f518c6c5031f931909132"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"At this point, it seemed like decision tree was my best performer.
