In many cases, often the distributions of these attributes are skewed in the sense that some sets of values will occur a lot and some will be very rare. Besides that, there is also the added problem of varying range of these values. Consider `Age` and `TicketFare` in our dataset.\n\nIn some cases, the view counts will be abnormally large and in some cases very small. Directly using these features in modeling might cause issues. Metrics like similarity measures, cluster distances, regression coefficients and more might get adversely affected if we use raw numeric features having values which range across multiple orders of magnitude. There are various ways to engineer features from these raw values so we can these issues. One method would be **binning**.\n\n The operation of binning is used for transforming continuous numeric values into discrete ones. These discrete numbers can be thought of as bins into which the raw values or numbers are binned or grouped into.

By reducing the training data, we risk losing important patterns/ trends in data set, which in turn increases error induced by bias. So, what we require is a method that provides ample data for training the model and also leaves ample data for validation. K Fold cross validation does exactly that.\n\nIn K Fold cross validation, the data is divided into k subsets. Now the holdout method is repeated k times, such that each time, one of the k subsets is used as the test set/ validation set and the other k-1 subsets are put together to form a training set. The error estimation is averaged over all k trials to get total effectiveness of our model. As can be seen, every data point gets to be in a validation set exactly once, and gets to be in a training set k-1 times. This significantly reduces bias as we are using most of the data for fitting, and also significantly reduces variance as most of the data is also being used in validation set.
