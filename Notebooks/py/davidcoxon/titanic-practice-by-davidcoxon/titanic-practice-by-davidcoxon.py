# # Predicting Titanic Survivers
# Like Titanic, this is my maiden voyage,  when it comes to Kaggle contest that is!. I've completed the Data Science track on Data Camp, but I'm a relative newbie when it comes to machine learning. I'm going to attempt to work my way through the Titanic: Machine Learning contest. My aim is to submission and initial entry as quickly as possible to get a base line score and then attempt to improve on  on it by first looking at missing data, then engineering key features before establishing a  secondary base line and trying to improve the model itself. I'd like to be able to achieve a score of .80
# 
# Please feel free to post comments or  make suggestions as to what i may be doing wrong or could maybe do better and  consider upvoting if you find the notebook useful!
# 
# Because this notebook has built up over time I have commented out some of the lines that output files so that when i want to output and test a slight change to the code, i don't output files for bit of the notebook that haven't been changed and that i am not especially intereted in. If you are forking this code you can simple remove the hash and output the file. I have also experimented with different models, so the current model in any stage is not necessarily the most efficent (its just the one that i tried last).

Interestingly Embarkation port Q seems to indicate that  only 1 man survived while all women with passenger ID below 500 seem to survive while those above didn't this may be chance but it does look odd compared to 'S' and 'C'.

# # Stage 2 : Clean Data & Engineer features to improve results
# 
#  
# 
# ## Cleaning the data : Filling in the blanks
# There are a number of missing values, including fare, embarked, age and cabin. I started off simply using the average value for fare, embarked and age. However after doing some visual data analysis it became obvious that I could use other factors like title to make better estimates on age by simply using the average for people with the same title, the same applied to embarked where average based on fare would give a better estimate and fare based on embarked. 
# 
# Cabin has so much missing data that it is likely that estimating cabin may add a level of noise to the data that would not be helpful.
# 
# ## Feature conversion
# Some models work better with with categorical data other numberical data,  while some work best with binaryl data. In some cases this is as simple as changing male and female to numeric data like 0 or 1. We can replace categorical data like embarkation port  's' to values numeric value 1 or title Master to value 3 Values like age that range from 1 to 80 can be scaled so they a represented by a value between 0 and 1. Scaling values means that features are not given a disproportionate importance simply because they are larger, another option for values like Age or Fare are to split them into a more manageable bands which can then be represented as categories so.  Alternately we could put each categorical value into a column of its own, marking each columns with a 0 if they don't apply or a 1 if they do. After doing some initial data eploration i decided it was easiest to convert data into bands and columns, so that I could then compare the models with different options and decide which was best for each before making final predictions.
# 
# ## Feature Engineering
# Here I attempted to manipulate existing data in order to  try and create new features that i could use in my model, for example family size can be caluculated with the combination of siblings and parents, and title can be extracted from name. 

# ## Estimate missing Fare Data based on Embarkation
# While there is relatively little missing Fare data, the range of possible values is large, so rather than using simply the media of all fares, we can look at the passenger class or embarkation port in order to use a more appropriate average. We'll start by looking at boxplots for the fares to ensure we are making soon assumptions before we go onto estimating the missing values.

print('FareBand feature created')


# *** Note:*** There are several ways that machine learning can evaluate data, you can use discrete data like fare, or you can make that data categorical by grouping it into bands as i have done here or your can take those categories and turn each category into a column. Different models work, differently depending on how you give them the data. I'm going to create all 3 different structures for some features like fare and age and see how they compare. You shoud not over emphasis a feature by using multiple structures of the same data in a model, we'll therefore filter the differnet stuctures before we evaluate the models.

# ## Free Passage
# I noticed that the minimum fare is 0.00 and that the ticket type for some of those is 'LINE' .

# # Visualizing age data
# We could estimate all of the ages based on the mean and standard deviation of the data set, however as age is obviously an important feature in pridicting survival and we need to look at the other features and see if we can work out a way to make a more accurate estimate of age for any given passenger. First lets look at the different age distributions of passengers by title.

# In[ ]:


# Groupby title
df_train[['Title', 'Survived']].groupby(['Title'], as_index=False).mean()
# plot age distribution by title
facet = sns.FacetGrid(data = df_train, hue = "Title", legend_out=True, size = 5)
facet = facet.map(sns.kdeplot, "Age")
facet.add_legend();


# The age distribution looks slightly suspect and possibly merits further investigation, for example while master generally refers to male's under 16 there a number that are over 40, this might be explained if master is also a title in nautical terms like 'Master Seaman'. You might also expect a quite Normal distribution of ages for any given title, but in many cases this doesn't seem to be the case, this is most likely caused by out estimated numbers skewing the data, one way to avoid this would be to use a random number based on the standard deviation in the estimate for each to get a more natural dataset. We could also use age bands rather than age in the model.

# # Summary
# 
# In this project we have explored the Titanic Data Set, we have identified missing data and filled then as best we could, we have converted categorical data to columns of numeric features that we can use in machine learning and we have engineered new features based on the data we had. We improved our score from base line of 0.57894 to  a score of 0.78.
# 
# Going from a score of 0.57 to 0.77 was the relatively easy part, taking it from 7.8 to 0.8 is a whole different ball game. Its really temping to overwork the data trying to find new features that might improve the score but in really what you gain in new features you loose in the noise you've introduce, its also tempting to keep tweak the parameters of your model to get the best possible score on the test data, but gain what you gain in performance on the training data you loose in overfitting. A better approach is to stick to the features that have the strongest relationships and ensure that any data that you are estimating or engineering is as accurate as you can possibly make it. Using cross validation to hyper tune the model while minimising any over fitting of the data.
# 
# When I initially created the project I kept the test and training data completely separate but am I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that combining the two datasets,  is possibly a better approach for estimating missing data based on averages across the entire dataset. 
# 
# I  looked at a range of different models and compared the accuracy of each model on the training data before deciding which model to use for the third submission. I then hyper tuned  a hanful of the best performing to ensure that I submitted the best performing hyper tuned model. 
# 
# Having hypertuned a single model the next step in my process was to attempt combining several models in an ensemble. I managed to achieve a result of .803 which was OK but not as good as the best hypertuned models that i'd produced.
# 
# I havn't come any where near winning this contest yet, but I survived my first Kaggle contest and got a score of over .8 which has my goal. The main thing is that I had fun and learnt a lot along the way by trying different techniques and looking at what other people were doing.
# 
# I've also created a kernal that uses the same data with deep learning, you can find this at https://www.kaggle.com/davidcoxon/deeply-titanic

# # Credit where credits due
# 
# This competition is predominantly a training exercise and as such I have tried to looks at different approaches and try different techniques to see hw they work.  I have looked at some of the existing entries and adopted some of the tequiques that i have found interesting. So firstly a huge thanks to everyone that look the time to document their code and explain step by step what they did and why.
# 
# To naming names, some of the notebooks that i found most useful and think deserve special mensions are:
# 
# ### Aldemuro M.A.Haris
# https://www.kaggle.com/aldemuro/comparing-ml-algorithms-train-accuracy-90
# Interesting model comparison and ROC graphs
# 
# 
# ### Anisotropic
# https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/notebook
# 
# Introduction to Ensembling/Stacking in Python is a very useful project on many levels, in I particular I liked how elegantly this code was written.
# 
# ### Bisaria
# https://www.kaggle.com/bisaria/titanic-lasso-ridge-implementation/code
# 
# While this notebook is based on R and I am working in Python, I found some of the visualizations interesting, specifically the port of embarkation and number of siblings and the mosaic. I also liked the idea of the lone traveller feature and the allocation of the cabin data, based on family.
# 
# ### CalebCastleberry
# https://www.kaggle.com/ccastleberry/titanic-cabin-features
# 
# This notebook explains the importance of the deck feature and proves you can score 70% on the deck feature alone.
# 
# ### Henrique Mello 
# https://www.kaggle.com/hrmello/introduction-to-data-exploration-using-seaborn/notebook
# 
# This has some great visualisations of the data and helped me understand the importance of using title in predicting ages when filling in the missing data. 
# 
# ### Konstantin
# https://www.kaggle.com/konstantinmasich/titanic-0-82-0-83
# 
# ### LD Freeman
# https://www.kaggle.com/ldfreeman3/a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy
# 
# This not only achieves a fantastic score but is a great tutorial on data science techniques
# 
# ### Nadin Tamer
# https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/titanic-survival-predictions-beginner/notebook
# 
# I found this another really useful kernel. It is very much a step by step approach, with a particularly good section on different types of model and how they perform for this project.
# 
# ### Omar El Gabry
# https://www.kaggle.com/omarelgabry/a-journey-through-titanic?scriptVersionId=447802/notebook
# 
# This kernal has an interesting section on estimating the missing ages and calculating pearson co-efficients for the features.
# 
# ### Oscar Takeshita
# https://www.kaggle.com/pliptor/divide-and-conquer-0-82296/code
# 
# This kernal was very useful in trying to get over the 0.8 ceiling, its based on R rather than python so i haven't used any of the code, but it helped me focus on the key fearures and to see the benefits of uing the combined training and test dataset for statistics and calculations rather keeping the two at arms length. 
# 
# ### Sina
# https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic-best-working-classifier?scriptVersionId=566580
# 
# A lot of high scoring kernals reference this notebook, especially the feature engineering discussed in it.
# 
# ### S.Xu
# https://www.kaggle.com/shunjiangxu/blood-is-thicker-than-water-friendship-forever
# 
# This kernal is based on an original kernal by Sina, and it uses the last name and ticket details to find families and firends it then looks at the survival of the group as a whole.
# 
# ### Yassine Ghouzam
# https://www.kaggle.com/yassineghouzam/titanic-top-4-with-ensemble-modeling
# 
# This kernal has an interesting section on learning curves.
