I intend to use this Notebook to work on Feature Engineering and slicing data in DataFrame to prepare it for Machine Learning libraries. \n\nThe second goal of this Jupyter Notebook is to see if we can predict with reasonable accuracy whether the character of Jack Dawson(portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio) from James Cameron's Titanic would have survived. I have scoured the Internet chatrooms to find trivia information about the character and seen the movie again just to see if I can get information which related to the variables looked at in this dataset. \n \nI was able to find only segmented information regarding the character mostly because he isn't supposed to be on Titanic. He wins tickets from unnamed Swedes in gambling. The tickets however are for 3rd class and is a man of age 20 years and has no faily on board. \n\nSo, to recap, this Notebook is split into two parts:\n* Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic Dataset \n* Setting up Machine Learning Classifers for four major algorithms used for classification problems and use each of them to see whether Jack would have survived or not."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9c4f34472b2a976262a341e8e77eaef551019dc9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <font color='Purple'>IMPORT LIBRARIES FOR DATA ANALYSIS</font>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Libraries for data analysis\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <font color = 'purple'> Import data </font>\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2af297d56d20c1c1a05ac326bb8f862156366857"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest_data = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9b87891c85d6d948248b2b113bfd2c1b0aad1391"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <font color = 'purple'> There are different number of columns in train and test data.

REGRESSION\n\n**Basic intro for Logistic Regression**\n* Logistic Regression is used binary classification problems.\n* Based on Sigmoid function which classifies a new point as class A or B depending on whether it is above or below a certain threshold value X.\n* This serves as a powerful way of classifying binary problems becuase it only cares about whether a new value is above or below a certain threshold. \n* Hence, I used this algorithm for this problem\n![](http://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RqXFpiNGwdiKBWyLJc_E7g.png)\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"bd0183b652cc6577d832b3a5a7627c18d27a995f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#
