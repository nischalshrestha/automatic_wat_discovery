# # Machine Learning to Predict Titanic Survivors 
# Hi, I'm a current undergraduate student interested in the Data Science and Machine Learning field. In this Kernel, I will try to step by step build a ML model using sklearn to predict the outcomes of each passenger aboard the titanic. This guide is meant for people starting with data visualization, analysis and Machine Learning. If that sounds like you, then you're in the right place! It is not as difficult as you think to understand.
# 
# *Please upvote and share if this helps you!! Also, feel free to fork this kernel to play around with the code and test it for yourself. If you plan to use any part of this code, please reference this kernel!* I will be glad to answer any questions you may have in the comments. Thank You! 
# 

# ## Update
# Thank you all so much for the support and reading this kernel! I am very inspired to keep learning and I hope you are too. I am in the progress of making more kernels for more competitions as well as ones for data visualization and statistics. Please stay tuned for those, as I will be publishing them very soon! Again, thank you so much and please feel free to contact me or ask any questions!

# # 1. Importing Libraries and Packages
# We will use these packages to help us manipulate the data and visualize the features/labels as well as measure how well our model performed. Numpy and Pandas are helpful for manipulating the dataframe and its columns and cells. We will use matplotlib along with Seaborn to visualize our data.

# In[ ]:


import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 

import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
get_ipython().magic(u'matplotlib inline')
sns.set_style("whitegrid")

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")


# <a id="p2"></a>
# # 2. Loading and Viewing Data Set
# With Pandas, we can load both the training and testing set that we wil later use to train and test our model. Before we begin, we should take a look at our data table to see the values that we'll be working with. We can use the head and describe function to look at some sample data and statistics. We can also look at its keys and column names.

# In[ ]:


training = pd.read_csv("../input/train.csv")
testing = pd.read_csv("../input/test.csv")


# In[ ]:


training.head()


# In[ ]:


training.describe()


# In[ ]:


print(training.keys())
print(testing.keys())

# # 3. Dealing with NaN Values (Imputation)
# There are NaN values in our data set in the age column. Furthermore, the Cabin column has too many missing values and isn't useful to be used in predicting survival. We can just drop the column as well as the NaN values which will get in the way of training our model. We also need to fill in the NaN values with replacement values in order for the model to have a complete prediction for every row in the data set. This process is known as **imputation** and we will show how to replace the missing data.

# In[ ]:


def null_table(training, testing):
    print("Training Data Frame")
    print(pd.isnull(training).sum()) 
    print(" ")
    print("Testing Data Frame")
    print(pd.isnull(testing).sum())

null_table(training, testing)


# In[ ]:


training.drop(labels = ["Cabin", "Ticket"], axis = 1, inplace = True)
testing.drop(labels = ["Cabin", "Ticket"], axis = 1, inplace = True)

null_table(training, testing)


# We take a look at the distribution of the Age column to see if it's skewed or symmetrical. This will help us determine what value to replace the NaN values.

# In[ ]:


copy = training.copy()
copy.dropna(inplace = True)
sns.distplot(copy["Age"])


# Looks like the distribution of ages is slightly skewed right. Because of this, we can fill in the null values with the median for the most accuracy.

# In[ ]:


#the median will be an acceptable value to place in the NaN cells
training["Age"].fillna(training["Age"].median(), inplace = True)
testing["Age"].fillna(testing["Age"].median(), inplace = True) 
training["Embarked"].fillna("S", inplace = True)
testing["Fare"].fillna(testing["Fare"].median(), inplace = True)

# # 4. Plotting and Visualizing Data
# It is very important to understand and visualize any data we are going to use in a machine learning model. By visualizing, we can see the trends and general associations of variables like Sex and Age with survival rate. We can make several different graphs for each feature we want to work with to see the entropy and information gain of the feature. 

# **Gender**

# In[ ]:


#can ignore the testing set for now
sns.barplot(x="Sex", y="Survived", data=training)
plt.title("Distribution of Survival based on Gender")
plt.show()

total_survived_females = training[training.Sex == "female"]["Survived"].sum()
total_survived_males = training[training.Sex == "male"]["Survived"].sum()

print("Total people survived is: " + str((total_survived_females + total_survived_males)))
print("Proportion of Females who survived:") 
print(total_survived_females/(total_survived_females + total_survived_males))
print("Proportion of Males who survived:")
print(total_survived_males/(total_survived_females + total_survived_males))


# > Note that the numbers printed above are the proportion of male/female survivors of all the surviviors ONLY. The graph shows the propotion of male/females out of ALL the passengers including those that didn't survive.

# Gender appears to be a very good feature to use to predict survival, as shown by the large difference in propotion survived. Let's take a look at how class plays a role in survival as well.

# **Class**

# In[ ]:


sns.barplot(x="Pclass", y="Survived", data=training)
plt.ylabel("Survival Rate")
plt.title("Distribution of Survival Based on Class")
plt.show()

total_survived_one = training[training.Pclass == 1]["Survived"].sum()
total_survived_two = training[training.Pclass == 2]["Survived"].sum()
total_survived_three = training[training.Pclass == 3]["Survived"].sum()
total_survived_class = total_survived_one + total_survived_two + total_survived_three

print("Total people survived is: " + str(total_survived_class))
print("Proportion of Class 1 Passengers who survived:") 
print(total_survived_one/total_survived_class)
print("Proportion of Class 2 Passengers who survived:")
print(total_survived_two/total_survived_class)
print("Proportion of Class 3 Passengers who survived:")

plt.title("Survival Rates Based on Gender and Class")


# It appears that class also plays a role in survival, as shown by the bar graph. People in Pclass 1 were more likely to survive than people in the other 2 Pclasses.

sns.stripplot(x="Survived", y="Age", data=training, jitter=True)


# It appears as though passengers in the younger range of ages were more likely to survive than those in the older range of ages, as seen by the clustering in the strip plot, as well as the survival distributions of the histogram.

# Here is one final cumulative graph of a pair plot that shows the relations between all of the different features

# # 5. Feature Engineering
# Because values in the Sex and Embarked columns are categorical values, we have to represent these strings as numerical values in order to perform our classification with our model. We can also do this process through **One-Hot-Encoding**.

# In[ ]:


training.sample(5)


# In[ ]:


testing.sample(5)


# We change Sex to binary, as either 1 for female or 0 for male. We do the same for Embarked. We do this same process on both the training and testing set to prepare our data for Machine Learning.

# In[ ]:


training["FamSize"] = training["SibSp"] + training["Parch"] + 1
testing["FamSize"] = testing["SibSp"] + testing["Parch"] + 1


# This IsAlone feature also may work well with the data we're dealing with, telling us whether the passenger was along or not on the ship.

training["IsAlone"] = training.FamSize.apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 1 else 0)
testing["IsAlone"] = testing.FamSize.apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 1 else 0)


# Although it may not seem like it, we can also extract some useful information from the name column. Not the actual names themselves, but the title of their names like Ms. or Mr. This may also provide a hint as to whether the passenger survived or not. Therefore we can extract this title and then encode it like we did for Sex and Embarked.

# # 6. Model Fitting and Predicting
# Now that our data has been processed and formmated properly, and that we understand the general data we're working with as well as the trends and associations, we can start to build our model. We can import different classifiers from sklearn. We will try different types of models to see which one gives the best accuracy for its predictions.

# **Validation Data Set**
# 
# Although we already have a test set, it is generally easy to overfit the data with these classifiers. It is therefore useful to have a third data set called the validation data set to ensure that our model doesn't overfit with the data. We can make this third data set with sklearn's train_test_split function. We can also use the validation data set to test the general accuracy of our model.
