Some of them might be ordered. For instance,  **Grade** is a feature contain 4 levels: \"Ex\", \"Gd\", \"Ag\", \"Po\", meaning \"excellent\", \"good\", \"average\", \"poor\" respectively. To convert it into numerical type using dummy (or one-hot-encoding) is not a advisable choice. Please think in this way: Let D(x, y) be the distance between x and y, if D(\"Excellent\", \"Good\")=1, D(\"Good\", \"Average\")=1, D(\"Excellent\", \"Average\")=2. If we use dummy, the distance between each level are all equal to 1, which is intuitively wrong, especially when we want to build a regression model such as linear regression. \n\nThus we should convert such features into numerical values which can indicate the high or low of the level. To achieve this purpose, in the past, I chose map in pandas .\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nS = pd.DataFrame({'Grade':['Ex','Gd','Ag','Po']})\nprint('The original feature Grade:\\n',S)\nS['New_Grade'] = S['Grade'] .map({'Ex':4,'Gd':3,'Ag':2,'Po':1})\nprint('The feature Grade after transformation:\\n',S)","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f4967bc6a0fac133b915d8b7cb687b1758e84ac3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If you have experience in great machine learning package sklearn, you may say,\"Oh, it's too troublesome!
