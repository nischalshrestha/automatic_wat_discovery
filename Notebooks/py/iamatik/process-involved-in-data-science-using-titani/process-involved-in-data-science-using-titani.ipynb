Though, every problem has a different solution and approach, the basic components remains same in general.\n\n### Special NOTE:- The first and foremost thing you should always remember is you can't find the data first and then solve problems. You should always find the problems first, formulate it, and ask, is it the problem that can be solved by Data Science and Machine Learning/ Deep Learning techniques. As, ML is not a solution for every problem on earth. Anyways, let's dive into the process, I just want to tell people about this small, but important thing!\n\n## Let's describe the components invloved in the Data Science process\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n* **Data acquiring/gathering/collecting** - Data often comes from various sources such as database, web requests, surveys, etc. It can be in the structured, semi-structured or unstructured form. Python/R has good packages/libraries that can take care of data ingestion and manipulation.\n\n* **Data Preparation** - This is a very crucial step and often this is the step where most data scientists spends time on. This step helps in understanding your data rigorously, also you get to know about the statistics of the data and its distribution. A basic exploratory analysis can be done by visualizing the data and see if there is an anomaly in your data or is it disributed in a strange manner. Another important thing done on this step is taking care of the NULL/NaN values (In real world this is a very common scenario) using various data impuation techniques or simply removing the samples (The data impuations/removal is highly dependent on how well your domain knowledge is for the specific problem).\n\n* **Analyze Data** - Once your data is pre-processed, the data is ready in the form where it can be feed into the analytics system. There are many ways of analyzing your data, the most common is through stastical and machine learning techniques. After you choose your techniques, you build a model in this step (Building model simply means, training or learning your data with help of learning algorithms and then use this model for further predictions (on unseen data) based on the seen/learned data).\n\n* **Report your findings** - Once you are statisfied with the results, often you have to communicate this result/findings to the higher authority or a non-technical person. This step is the most important one, because if you can't communicate your findings, the whole point of the process becomes useless. These days, Data Science team in most companies is responsible for market growths, analyzing trends, profits, and studying users behaviour (list goes on and on, just describing few of them!). Hence, your findings should be in such a manner that a non-technical person can understand your reports/graphs/charts and can take data-driven actions.\n\n## These are the basic components invloved in data science process\n\n### Enough of the reading, I know you must be bored by now! Let's dive into the actual code and go through with each step with the titanic data\n\n   "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"54f3f3489f932f03a1ac2e8d8a2d6be48639f983"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Importing the libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"b70b88ad39d4660bf0228836cec74e7328b922eb"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np      \nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Importing the data "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"8bfbd7081e563dae15e32944be7cb86ccfe7e358"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest_data = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"65c26044feb793ed11fa141dcf6c9f9e2895fb38"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Let's look at our data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5953377b4e824e3e30aeb22fc81c557f166e074b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"25cb535a6e4f57955340db000861c576eb24b284"},"cell_type":"code","source":"test_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"5ad9ac94f880b9c29f45129c9ae3b832320c662b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### From the data, we can see that pre-processing is required.

You asked the right question. Let's discuss why this mapping is bad for the machine learning model. If we map these numbers with the categories, what will happen is that machine learning model will learn and interpret those mappings according to the values of those categories. It will simply learn S being the highest value, Q being the med value and C being the lower value. But, in reality these value has nothing to do with the precedence. These C,Q, & S is just simply the port from where the passengers embarked. So by mapping these values, it will create bias for lower/higher values depending on the problem. This is the reason behind using vectors (One Hot Encoding) instead of simply mapping the values.\n\n### Sometimes we have to convert the label for our training data, then in that case we can simply map the numbers.
