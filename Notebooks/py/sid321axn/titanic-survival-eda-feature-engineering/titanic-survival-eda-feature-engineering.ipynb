Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive. The need for manual feature engineering can be obviated by automated feature learning.\n\nFeature Engineering can simply be defined as the process of creating new features from the existing features in a dataset. Let’s consider a sample data that has details about a few items, such as their weight and price.\n\n<img src=\"https://image.ibb.co/dHgyR9/feat-engg-example.png\" alt=\"text\">****\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"91cb6c9daa3858a65bbb66be83270cf095a2ed2e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, to create a new feature we can use Item_Weight and Item_Price.
