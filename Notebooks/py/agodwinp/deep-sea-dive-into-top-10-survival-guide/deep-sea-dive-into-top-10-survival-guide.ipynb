Some are capable of handling them, but others are not. Therefore since we are using a variety of algorithms, it's best to treat them in an appropriate way.\n\n**If you have missing values, you have two options**:\n- Delete the entire row\n- Fill the missing entry with an imputed value\n\nUnfortunately, our dataset for training is very small. Therefore we want to preserve as much of the data as we can, so that the algorithms can learn from more examples. This means that deleting entire rows is not a suitable option. Hence, we must fill these missing values.\n\n\nA missing value is an entry in a column that has no assigned value. This can mean multiple things:\n- A missing value may be the **result of an error during the production of the dataset**. This could be a human error, or machinery error depending on where the data comes from. \n    - In the context of the Titanic dataset, it is likely that this data was originally recorded on pen and paper, since we are talking about the year 1912. Therefore, perhaps the missing values were the result of information being lost over time? Or maybe the clerk that kept hold of this data, did not record it properly as the ship was being boarded?\n- A missing value in some cases, may just mean a that a **'zero'** should be present. In which case, it can be replaced by a 0.\n- However, missing values represent no information. Therefore, **does the fact that you don't know what value to assign an entry, mean that filling it with a '0' is always a good fit?** \n\nMissing values must be treated with a lot of care, as whatever you fill it with comes with assumptions. These assumptions must be outlined and taken into consideration when working with the data.\n\nTo decide how we should fill these values, let's see which columns contain them."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6c0b87536000d179cf10870a597c3567869dc164","_cell_guid":"5619cb08-a310-47dd-8069-5b89c1742be8","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"full.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b05a875fa1625e59ae61c56eaeac89b921aed62c","_cell_guid":"1beae051-4214-44c6-8a46-2f659e33b47d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So we have missing values for **Age**, **Cabin**, **Embarked** and **Fare**.\nThe 418 missing values for **Survived** represent the 418 rows from the test dataset that we appended to the training data.\n\nThe following table presents some descriptive statistics to help us fill the missing values."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4778db224a385ade85cfa2be7b2aaa1f82ecbd8f","_cell_guid":"4ecd1d95-e3a5-4654-af3b-5dadfee5e805","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"full.describe(include='all')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8a67e646d5ab1d91bea82e7a08741ed17be8461a","_cell_guid":"c06c62b4-5b6d-4d1b-9888-3f50da2d3e25"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"And the following correlation matrix can give us guidance on how to fill the numerical columns with missing values."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"441292d965151a3f86086152767b647f96284f1b","_cell_guid":"b2fa1f5b-f13f-4b0d-a17a-2479c708a735","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Correlation matrix between numerical values (SibSp, Parch, Age and Fare) with Survived \nplt.subplots(figsize=(20, 15))\ng = sns.heatmap(full[[\"Survived\",\"SibSp\",\"Parch\",\"Age\",\"Fare\"]].corr(),annot=True, fmt = \".2f\", cmap = \"YlGnBu\", linewidths = 1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"98f6386c1e48d72488b1c634b0be25650a19a72c","_cell_guid":"f693d466-aa4b-41be-acdf-34186470d9cf"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.1.1 - Age"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"470ad0b8cfafebc348c8bdf2514a4270b9386864","_cell_guid":"4a243bea-94c1-43bc-8532-2cc5ed37e50a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the descriptive statistics above we can see that:\n- Age has a mean of approx. 29\n- Standard deviation of approx. 14\n- Minimum of approx. 0.17\n- Maximum of 80\n\nSo now we want to find a strategy for imputing the missing values of Age.

Hence, we much approach feature reduction carefully for each chosen model. No two reduced datasets will look the same for each model, unless we get lucky.\n\nThere are various ways to attempt to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. The methods that I chose to use were:\n- **Chi-squared** test of independance. This test measures dependence between stochastic variables, so using this function \"weeds out\" the features that are most likely to be independant of class and therefore irrelevant for classification.\n- **Extra Trees** feature importance. This is a built in attribute of trees based estimators, the higher to score of a feature, the more important it is. This can be used to discard irrelevant features when couples with SelectFromModel.\n\n*These first two methods of feature reduction were used for the algorithms that did not have the in-built feature_importances attribute.*\n\n- **\"feature__importances_\"**. This is a built in attribute for some estimators that will indicate the higher the feature, the more important it is.\n- **Recursive Feature Elimination**. Given an estimator that assigns weights to features, such as coefficients, RFE is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of features and the importance of each feature is obtained by the \"coef_\" or the \"feature__importances_\" attribute. Then, the least important features are pruned from the data. RFECV performs RFE in a cross-validation loop to find the optimal number of featurs.\n\nThe first two methods, **chi-squared and extra trees**, will provide us a reduced dataset without depending on the algorithm. Hence, for estimators without the \"feature__importances_\" attribute built in, we can re-use the reduced datasets produced. I will first create these reusable datasets to make life easier later.\n\n**Note**: Moving forward I will use the reduced feature set that produces the best average training score and test accuracy for each model. In the case where two reduced feature sets produce comparable results, a trade-off will be necessary. Also consider that during optimisation, these scores are likely to increase.\n\n### Chi-squared reduction"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"27e3ec63dbf1821abe7c42f33fb699f867dcb56f","_cell_guid":"bbedb27b-fdae-47e4-b57b-e4631f616c27","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Because the chi2 test will be the same for each model, we only need to run this test once.\n# When we have established which features are the most important via this test, we can re-use this \n# reduced dataset for all other estimators without \"feature_importances_\"\n\n# chi2 test of independence\n\n# fit a model using a score function of chi2\nKbest = SelectKBest(score_func=chi2, k=10)\nfit = Kbest.fit(X_train, Y_train)\n\n# Create a table with the results and score for each features\nscores = pd.DataFrame({'Columns': X_test.columns.values, 'Score': fit.scores_})\n\n# Visualise the scores of dependence with a barplot\nplt.subplots(figsize=(15, 10))\ng = sns.barplot('Score','Columns',data = scores, palette=mycols,orient = \"h\")\ng.set_xlabel(\"Importance\")\ng = g.set_title(\"Feature Importances using Chi-squared\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5c3c653b49a3c3575fc8219ac559e954ed8d268a","_cell_guid":"092577e6-9416-43c5-b8a1-f5e397133714"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- From this, we can see that there are only a **small number of features that have a high importance**.\n- There are a lot of features with very low importance and we can get rid of."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1795f52ae3dc0e60afd6a219b833cc19a9a6785c","_cell_guid":"bd357618-cce7-4073-9e51-c3a229740cfa","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# First I will take some copies of the original estimation, validation and test datasets\n# so that we don't mess with these\nchi2_reduced_train = X_train.copy()\nchi2_reduced_test = X_test.copy()\nchi2_reduced_final_test = test.copy()\n\n# Now I will drop all of the columns that I deemed to be irrelevant\n# I played with a variety of options here, but this is what I found to work best\ndrop = ['SibSp', 'Age_0-16', 'Age_16-32', 'Age_32-48', 'Age_48-64', 'Cabin_A', 'Cabin_F',\n        'Cabin_G', 'Embarked_Q', 'Embarked_S', 'Fare_Low', 'Fare_Medium', 'Title_Rare',\n        'Title_Master','Title_Rare', 'Ticket Has Prefix',\n        'Age_64+', 'Cabin_A', 'Cabin_F', 'Cabin_G', 'Cabin_T']\n\n# Reduce features of estimation, validation and test for use in modelling\nchi2_reduced_train.drop(drop, axis = 1, inplace = True)\nchi2_reduced_test.drop(drop, axis = 1, inplace = True)\nchi2_reduced_final_test.drop(drop, axis = 1, inplace = True)\n\n# You'll see that we now have just 18 features\nprint('X_train: ', chi2_reduced_train.shape, '\\nX_test: ', chi2_reduced_test.shape, '\\nY_train: ', Y_train.shape, '\\nY_test: ', Y_test.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"be39f575f51d450d45510cdfee5fca5070893b57","_cell_guid":"2779cc5a-e130-4409-b3d8-92053959ec43"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Extra Trees reduction"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"606286a5ebea7394f6b1e789a478e26a0f93dc55","_cell_guid":"a400d844-30aa-4b70-92ea-36b96c48bd91","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Now I will do the same for the extra trees method of feature reduction\n# Which once again, can be reused for estimators that do not have the feature_importances_ attribute\n\n# First, let's fit a model using the extra trees classifier\nmodel = ExtraTreesClassifier()\nmodel.fit(X_train, Y_train)\n\n# And create a table with the importances\nscores = pd.DataFrame({'Columns': X_test.columns.values, 'Score': model.feature_importances_})\nscores.sort_values(by='Score', ascending=False)\n\n# Finally let's visualise this\nplt.subplots(figsize=(15, 10))\ng = sns.barplot('Score','Columns',data = scores, palette=mycols,orient = \"h\")\ng.set_xlabel(\"Importance\")\ng = g.set_title(\"Feature Importances using Trees\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"08b11ca3ffd50bc8b88904e230dabd91dc02976c","_cell_guid":"48711f78-cb56-47d4-9bef-68350b29b7fc"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- In comparison to the chi-squared test, we see a slightly **increased number of features that are important**.

Optimisation of selected models\n\n***Optimisation is the operation of fine tuning the parameters of each individual estimator to improve the performance.*** For detailed information, please see the documentation for the algorithms within the Acknowledgments.\n- **However, each estimator has many different parameters, so how do you know which to choose?**\n- Luckily, we have a really nice package at our disposal - **GridSearchCV**.\n    - This allows you to define a \"grid\" of parameters for the estimator to try, and it will tell you the best combination!\n- In order to find the best combination of parameters, you'll more than often want to try lots of different options and therefore your grid will be large.\n- This is quite simply, **a massive computational task**. Without gargantuan processing power, this can take days to complete - my computer is not powerful and it really did take that long.\n- **There are ways around this**:\n    - Get a more powerful computer (very expensive).\n    - Use Cloud infrastructure, such as GCP or AWS (very cheap and you get $300 free when you sign up).\n        - I tried GCP and this is an excellent option.\n        \nSo, within this section **I will show and explain how to use GridSearchCV**. However for computational reasons, I will not include the full grid that I ran, and **I will leave it up to you to find the optimal combination of parameters**. Researching each algorithm and understanding it's inner workings will help guide you when choosing your grid.\n\nWe will optimise the models in the same order that we reduced the features:\n- ***KNN***\n- ***Support Vector Machine***\n- ***Gradient Boosting Classifier***\n- ***XGBoost***\n- ***Multi Layer Perceptron***\n- ***Linear SVMC***\n- ***Random Forest***\n- ***Logistic Regression***\n- ***Decision Tree***\n- ***Adaboost***\n- ***Extra Tree***\n\n**Note**:  Some optimised models may show drastically improved results from the vanilla model, some may only be small or not at all. Nevertheless, moving forward I will continue to work with the optimised models. \n\n### ***K-Nearest Neighbours***\n\n- Using **chi-squared** reduced dataset."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c7621057530af50738fedb0f76b967ee63e572c5","_cell_guid":"c6ac6b8f-48c8-46cf-aa1a-ecc9224b228e","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# K-Nearest Neighbours\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier()\n\n# First I will present the original paramters and scores from the model before optimisation\nprint('BEFORE -
