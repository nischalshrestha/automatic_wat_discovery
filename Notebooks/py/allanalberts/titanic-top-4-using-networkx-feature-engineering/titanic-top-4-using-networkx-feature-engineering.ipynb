Introduction \nThis notebook makes use of NetworkX to engineer three new features which, used by themselves in a simple DecisionTree, result in a Kaggle prediction in the top 4% (0.81818). \n\nWith limited lifeboat seats, the Captain of the Titanic ordered that Women and Children board life boats first. However, these chivalrous actions were not always followed and this model will predict when that behavior occurs. For example, passengers traveling with family members may have made different life or death decisions than those traveling alone. \n\nUsing the initial hypothesis that women and children will generally survive, while men will perish results in a Kaggle score of 0.76076. To improve upon this score we need to predict when the exception occurs, specifically when women/children die or when men live. We can speculate that women and children may be more likely to die if other women or children that they are traveling with die, and likewise, adult men may be more likely to live if other adult men that they are traveling with live.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we must first determine which passengers are traveling together. This model utilizes NetworkX to assign passengers together into social networks. Passengers are assigned to the graph as nodes. A four step process then adds edges to the graph to connect the passenger nodes to each other using shared ticket numbers and family names. This results in 53% of the passengers being joined together in connected component subgraphs (passenger groups/networks). \n\nNext, we need to determine the known survival rates of women/children and adult men traveling in these networks. Because we don't know everyones survival status, we need to create a new field that is slightly different from the existing Survival field. Passengers that we know lived are assigned a status of +1 and those that died are assigned a status of -1. We assign a status of 0 for passenger where we don't know their fate.  This system allows us to engineer an average known survival rate feature for each passenger network using a value falling somewhere between -1 (all died) and +1 (all lived). This feature is individually calculated for each passenger so that we don't incur data leakage from the current passenger (similar to how Parch and SibSp fields don't include the current passenger in their calculation). \n\nThat's it! Three features: Ptype_AdultM (Adult Men), Nstatus_F_Ch (known survival status of Women/Children in a network), and Nstatus_AdultM (known survival status of Adult Men in a network). Feel free to fork this Kernel and incorporate these features in your model. I'd love to hear how you have improved upon this prediction. Best of luck!"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"4f48e591bea0138e3b1cc26782e5e2465e9e38aa"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# Visualize the Decision Tree Classifier\nfrom sklearn.externals.six import StringIO  \nfrom IPython.display import Image  \nfrom sklearn.tree import export_graphviz\nimport pydotplus\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3a964ff6e20dcf205fc30333b1ff0f11593ff258"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

Likewise, adult men may live of other adult men that they are traveling with live. To test this, we will create fields to measure the survival rates of other women/children in each passengers network. The same will be done of the survival rates of adult men.\n\n- The known survival status for an individual passenger is defined as: survived=1, perished=-1, unknown=0\n- The network status for each passenger represents the average survival status of the other passengers they are traveling with in their network.\n- **Nstatus_F_Ch** is the average known survival status of the Women and Children in their network\n- **Nstatus_AdultM** is the average known survival status of men in their network.\n- Data leakage is avoided by not including the passenger in the calculation of their networks's overall survival status.\n- The network status features (Nstatus_F_Ch & Nstatus_AdultM) are defined on a continuum from -1 (all perished) to +1 (all survived). \n- Non-networked passengers who are traveling alone will have network status values of zero."},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"acff9cb8d9d9a39d9c2014f82740fb302c325e1c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create supporting passenger feature, Status, with values: -1=status dead, 0=unknown status, 1=status survived\ndata['Status'] = data.Survived.fillna(0)  # unknown survival status=0\ndata['Status'] = np.where(data.Survived==0, -1, data.Status)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"1dabd14be75962d52edad902433ac3f7d6bbbceb"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# For each passenger that is in a Network (NetworkNum!=0), update Network average status for the passengers\n# that are of this type, exclusive of the current passenger.\n\ndef update_passenger_network_status(data, Type):\n    NstatusField = 'Nstatus' + Type\n    PtypeField = 'Ptype' + Type\n    \n    data[NstatusField] = 0\n    data.set_index('PassengerId', inplace=True)\n    \n    # step through each passenger network\n    for n in data[data.NetworkNum!=0].NetworkNum.unique():\n\n        # calculate the Network totals for this passenger type inclusive of the all qaulified passengers\n        NetworkSum = data[(data.NetworkNum==n)&(data[PtypeField]==1)].Status.sum()\n        NetworkSize = data[data.NetworkNum==n][PtypeField].sum()\n\n        # step though each passenger in the network and update their network status\n        for index, row in data[(data.NetworkNum==n)].iterrows():\n            PNetworkSum = NetworkSum\n            PNetworkSize = NetworkSize \n            \n            # If passenger type = Type then reduce PNetworkSum and PNetworkSize by one.
