You create apps that users get to create and update certain data through various interfaces. You are a transducer of data. But how does that data look as a whole? And what insights would you gain from this data to improve your web product? In this tutorial, we will take a first dive into Data Science: an art and science to gain insights from data.\n\nThere are two parts to this tutorial: Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Building.\n\nThis tutorial assumes no pre-requisites other than basic coding literacy and an open-mind to learn as-you-go, the most important attribute of a data science enthusiast.\n\n## Take the helm\nWelcome aboard this *HMS Kernel*. I'm your First Mate, Andrew, to sail alongside with you on your maiden voyage (aka beginner tutorial) braving the seas of exploratory data analysis and predictive model building in python. We'll be using various popular libraries such as pandas (data handling), matplotlib and seaborn (basic plotting), bokeh (interactive visualization), and scikit-learn (machine learning). We'll take everything step-by-step, and let things slowly \"sink-in\".  *cough*\n\nBefore we leave port, let's import."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"bb7f772b-5fea-4045-92dc-f6fd896b2653","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"69e256411b98225bf492bead7a34bd44cd19fb8b","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"128a0b55-36d3-4638-9913-47d33b9c2d73","_uuid":"df112b1d73a1c38df81d0cc6b16eb6e810f78c74"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Inspect the Data\n\nWe have just loaded the data. You must have realized by now that we have, in fact, two data files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. They are exactly what their names suggest: the *train* dataset will be used to train our model, and the *test* dataset will be used to test how well our model performs. For now, let's focus on the train dataset which we just loaded.  The CSV (comma-separated-value) format is very popular for storing tabular data, data with rows and columns. You can also open the file and inspect it in any spreadsheet applications. But since we have python, we don't have to. Instead, use the following commands to get an idea of what we are dealing with.\n\nRemember: we are interested in who lived, and who didn't.\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"bd2af3d8-521b-4b1c-a751-2716318bc5a0","_uuid":"35ed97ad23f93995927d6264a9b3ddb1f6fc3036","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.columns\ndf.info()\ndf.head()\ndf.tail()\ndf.describe()\n!ls ../input\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"71c1b26a-cf90-4b02-8373-c6306dfbdc97","_uuid":"4d6c1d2ed4bc2b2ff73666a06131ae1078045c9f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## EDA\nNow we have an idea about the shape of the data and what variables it entails, let's make some plots to have a sense of how the variables relate.\nA great way to getting a bird's eye view is a pairplot.

We color-code the points so that we can see whether that observation (passenger) survived (1) or not (0). \n\nNote: to do this we need to make sure there are no missing values in the data.
