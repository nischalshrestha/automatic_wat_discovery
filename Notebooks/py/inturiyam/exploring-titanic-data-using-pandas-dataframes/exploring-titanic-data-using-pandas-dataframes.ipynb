That being the case, one might make several mistakes along the way. So this section itself was added as an after thought in V.11. Upto V.11., the best accuracy on Test data I got was about 77%. I had built a[ DNN model using Keras ](https://www.kaggle.com/inturiyam/titanic-survivor-prediction-using-keras) to do the predictions. Since I could not improve the performance any further, I decided that it was best to come back to the data set and try improve the features and fix some mistakes. Here is a quick summary of mistakes I made:\n\n*Mistakes made upto V.11*\na. I did not one-hot-encode PClass. That was a blunder ! \n\nb. I had not done Feature Scaling of Fare here (instead I was doing it in the Keras notebook). And when I had done Feature Scaling, I made a mistake of dividing it by Mean ! \n\nc. Initially I tried creating a column called \"High Probability Survivor Group\" based on my inference from titles people had. I was trying to bias the model in a way. I fixed it subsequently by simply doing one-hot-encoding. \n\nd. Also I had not inferred much from the Cabin column. I did so subsequently. \n\n*An important note on Mean and Median*\nI found that several notebooks on this competition impute age and fare values using some method or the other. Here I am going to try mark the missing Age values with Median instead of mean and try running models to see if they are any better. The sample here is small and it is likely that there are some Age outliers or Fare outliers. It seems Median is better when datasets have outliers than using the Mean.
