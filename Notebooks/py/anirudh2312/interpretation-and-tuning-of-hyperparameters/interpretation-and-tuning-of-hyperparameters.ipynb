Finally, this notebook will analyse, why some of the better performing algorithms are not a good fit for this problem/dataset.      \n\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. The challenge is to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. \n\n This is a standard supervised classification task:\n- __Supervised:__ The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features\n- __Classification:__ The label is a binary variable, 0 (not survived the tragedy), 1 (survived the tragedy)\n\nThe __evaluation metric__ for this problem is 'accuracy', i.e. how many of our predictions are correct.\n\n__Note__: This is my first ever notebook in terms of a machine learning project. So, I am learning with this work, and if anybody has any suggestions or feedback with respect to this notebook, then please comment. And, if you like the work, then please upvote.  \n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"20a1b992e20eff5488e044d6b4ba9ee6ba548646"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data\nThe data is taken from the kaggle's titanic competition website.

Hence, we need to find a way to encode these variables as numbers before feeding them to our model. There are many types of encoding techniques but the two main techniques are:\n\n- Label Encoding: assign each unique class in a categorical variable with an integer, randomly. No new columns are created\n- One Hot Encoding: create a new column for each unique class in a categorical variable. Each entry recieves a 1 in the column for its corresponding class and a 0 in all other new columns\n\nThe drawback of the label encoding is that it assigns arbitrary ordering to the classes of the categorical variables which do not reflect the inherent properties/information of that variable and label encoding may be misleading in this case. When we have only 2 unique classes (like male/female) for a categorical variable or if we have more than 2 unique classes and we already know the relative ordering of the classes (like, low/medium/high), then we can go with label encoding but here also, we need to ensure that the integer values assigned to these classes align with the relative order of the classes (like, low=0, medium=1 and high=2), otherwise one-hot encoding is the safe option.\n\nThe drawback of the one-hot encoding is that the number of new columns/features (dimensions of the data) can explode with the categorical variable having many unique classes because there will be a new column for each unique class in the variable. To deal with the feature exploding problem, we can use dimensionality reduction techniques like, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) after one-hot encoding.

So, if we make C very large to get most of the training data correct, then we may compromise with the generalisation property (robustness) of the model. In some cases, even when the data is truly linearly separable, we would like to tradeoff a small C for greater margins to make our model robust, especially in case of noisy data.\n\nWhen our data is not linear in the given dimensions, then to make our classifier more powerful, we do basis transformation.

One answer to this question is Early Stopping. The tree grows in such a manner so as to minimize the loss function or the error by recursively splitting the variables, but at some point, the improvement in the error is not significant, then we can stop. This stopping is called as early stopping. \n\nEarly stopping might not be a good idea in some situations. For example, let's say there are two variables to split on - x1 and x2. Consider all the possible ways where we can split x1. Suppose, we are not getting any improvement in the error by splitting on x1. Now, consider all the possible ways where we can split x2. Again we are not getting any error improvement. At this point, early stopping may stop this recursive algorithm and give the final results. But what if we can get error improvement by first splitting on x1 and then on x2. Early stopping may miss out on these interactions of variables such as in this case- first split on x1 and then on x2.\n\nTo avoid the problem created by early stopping, there is a second strategy to stop the tree algorithm, which is stop the splitting when the leaves are small. This means that when the number of data points in the region defined by the leaf of the tree are very small, then stop the further splitting of that region. This small number we can define by ourselves with the help of __min_samples_leaf__ parameter and we can also tune this parameter.

It is fine to make mistakes in this stage on the data points that have been correctly classified upto the previous stage because the previous classifiers can possibly adjust for that. Adaboost classifier is a boosting technique which is based on exponential loss function.\n\nIn the case of bagging, we create multiple datasets and train a weak classifier on each of those sets parallely. So, Bagging classifier is inherently parallel and that is why it is fast as well. \n\nIn the case of boosting, first we assign weights to the data points. The data points that were misclassified in the previous stage will get higher weights in the current stage and those which were correctly classified will get lower weights. Then sample from those data points according to their weights. We create a training set by sampling from the data points given to us according to their weights. So, points for which weights are higher will get sampled more often and points for which weights are very low might not even appear in the dataset. So, if the point appears multiple times in the dataset and then we are trying to minimize the training error, we are likely to get that point correct. \n\nSince we are assigning weights to the data points at every stage according to the errors made in the previous stage, this makes boosting algorithm inherently serial, unlike bagging and that is why boosting is slow as well, in general.   \n\nSo, while tuning the adaboost classifier, we will tune the base estimators. Since adaboost requires sample weighting, those estimators which do not support sample_weights method cannot be used as base estimators, like LDA.

The goal of random forest is to reduce the correlation among trees. The idea is to start doing bagging as we normally do (create multiple training sets by bootstrapping). Then, start building trees on these datasets. So, in random forest what we do is at every node, randomly sample 't' features from 'p' feature set (t<p). Find out which is the best split variable among these 't' features alone and split on that. Generally, t=sqrt(p) or log(p) but we can select any value with the max_features parameter. \n\nIf we had just done bagging, at the root level, it is highly likely that each one of the bagged tree would have picked the same attribute. So, at the higher levels of the tree, it will look very similar. But in random forest, we are getting rid of that. This leads to significant reduction in variance in the bagged estimate, especially when we have small feature set. \n\nTuning random forest is just like tuning decision trees, except here, since we are bagging lot of decision trees, we need to tune the no. of estimators parameter. With small dataset and small feature set, large number of estimators can sometimes lead to overfitting.

Although they are among the highest performers in terms of mean test accuracy, but they are facing the overfitting problem. \n\nEnsemble methods mainly works in two ways:\n\n- either they sample the data multiple times and make many datasets (like bootstrapping), and on each dataset a classifier is being trained and then the combined result of each classifier is presented as output\n- or on each dataset produced, a classifier is being trained with a randomly chosen subset of the features set, and then the combined result of each classifier is presented as output. \n\nIn our case the dataset as well as the feature set, both are very small. So, while building the ensemble model, there is high probability that the different datasets produced have almost the same type of samples or since there are very few features, the different classifiers are considering the same features again and again. Due to these two reasons, the different classifiers in an ensemble model maybe having high correlations with each other. Hence, they can create the problem of overfitting, when the results of all these classifiers are combined.     \n\nNow, since decision tree algorithm is among the top performers, we can further try to improve the performance of this algorithm with sklearn's feature selection method by exploiting the feature_importance attribute of decision trees.
