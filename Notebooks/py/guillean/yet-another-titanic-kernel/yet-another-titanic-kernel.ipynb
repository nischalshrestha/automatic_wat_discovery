That is, in our Logistic Regression, we have a term (called $C$ in Sklearn's LogisticRegression class, usually in the literature, it's denoted as $1/C = \\alpha$ or $1/C = \\lambda$) that penalizes how complex our model is. If we make $C$ very small (i.e. $\\alpha, \\lambda$ very large), we force our model to be very simple, whereas making $C$ large ($\\alpha, \\lambda$ small) tells the optimizer that we don't care how complex our model is.\n\nIt's pretty easy to see why an overly simple model might be bad (of course, here's a super-simple model: we just predict 'survived' at every time!), but an overly-complex model is also bad. What can happen is that, the only world the classifier has seen is very small, and thus it 'overfits' to this particular set of samples we picked, predicting them perfectly. It may not be clear why we wouldn't want this, so an example is in order.\n\nHere's a model that is extremely 'complex' [1]: for every possible passenger name, we just store if they survived or not. With this, I'm going to do very well on the training set. In fact, I'm going to do *perfectly*. But now when it comes time to test, we'll have a bunch of names I've never seen before, so we're going to do awfully on the test set.\n\nSo, we want to pick the Goldilocks zone. We don't want to make our model impossibly complex, but making it too simple won't help anyone either, so how do we go about this? It's actually (surprisingly) simple[2]! We just train our model on a portion of data (say, 80%), and pretend that the rest of the data we don't have. *Then*, after training, we test it on the other 20% of data we held in escrow. In some sense, we pretend we're Kaggle and 'score' our model privately with data it has never seen before. We do this for a bunch of possible $C$ parameters, and pick the one that does the best on the test set.\n\nThis is what we'll do below, using some niceties that sklearn brings.\n\n---\n\n[1] I'm being pretty cavalier about using the term 'complex.' There are, indeed rigorous definitions of what this means, but we'll make use of the intuitive notion since I don't think adding complexity here helps (pun only partially intended).\n\n[2] Unlike a bunch of stuff in ML.
