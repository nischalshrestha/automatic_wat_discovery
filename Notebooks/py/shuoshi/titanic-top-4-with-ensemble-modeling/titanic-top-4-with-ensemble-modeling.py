# ## 1. Introduction
# 
# This is my first kernel at Kaggle. I choosed the Titanic competition which is a good way to introduce feature engineering and ensemble modeling. Firstly, I will display some feature analyses then ill focus on the feature engineering. Last part concerns modeling and predicting the survival on the Titanic using an voting procedure. 
# 
# This script follows three main parts:
# 
# * **Feature analysis**
# * **Feature engineering**
# * **Modeling**

# Since outliers can have a dramatic effect on the prediction (espacially for regression problems), i choosed to manage them. 
# 
# I used the Tukey method (Tukey JW., 1977) to detect ouliers which defines an interquartile range comprised between the 1st and 3rd quartile of the distribution values (IQR). An outlier is a row that have a feature value outside the (IQR +- an outlier step).
# 
# 
# I decided to detect outliers from the numerical values features (Age, SibSp, Sarch and Fare). Then, i considered outliers as rows that have at least two outlied numerical values.

# In[ ]:


train.loc[Outliers_to_drop] # Show the outliers rows


# We detect 10 outliers. The 28, 89 and 342 passenger have an high Ticket Fare 
# 
# The 7 others have very high values of SibSP.

# ## 3. Feature analysis
# ### 3.1 Numerical values

# In[ ]:


# Correlation matrix between numerical values (SibSp Parch Age and Fare values) and Survived 
g = sns.heatmap(train[["Survived","SibSp","Parch","Age","Fare"]].corr(),annot=True, fmt = ".2f", cmap = "coolwarm")


# Only Fare feature seems to have a significative correlation with the survival probability.
# 
# It doesn't mean that the other features are not usefull. Subpopulations in these features can be correlated with the survival. To determine this, we need to explore in detail these features

# #### SibSP

# In[ ]:


# Explore SibSp feature vs Survived
g = sns.factorplot(x="SibSp",y="Survived",data=train,kind="bar", size = 6 , 
palette = "muted")
g.despine(left=True)
g = g.set_ylabels("survival probability")


# Marked by Allen: Just try with another way to visulize the same data

# In[ ]:


sns.set_style('darkgrid')
sns.barplot(x="SibSp",y="Survived",data=train,palette='rainbow')


# It seems that passengers having a lot of siblings/spouses have less chance to survive
# 
# Single passengers (0 SibSP) or with two other persons (SibSP 1 or 2) have more chance to survive
# 
# This observation is quite interesting, we can consider a new feature describing these categories (See feature engineering)

# #### Parch

# In[ ]:


# Explore Parch feature vs Survived
g  = sns.factorplot(x="Parch",y="Survived",data=train,kind="bar", size = 6 , 
palette = "muted")
g.despine(left=True)
g = g.set_ylabels("survival probability")


# Small families have more chance to survive, more than single (Parch 0), medium (Parch 3,4) and large families (Parch 5,6 ).
# 
# Be carefull there is an important standard deviation in the survival of passengers with 3 parents/children 

# #### Age

# In[ ]:


# Explore Age vs Survived
g = sns.FacetGrid(train, col='Survived')
g = g.map(sns.distplot, "Age")



# Age distribution seems to be a tailed distribution, maybe a gaussian distribution.
# 
# We notice that age distributions are not the same in the survived and not survived subpopulations. Indeed, there is a peak corresponding to young passengers, that have survived. We also see that passengers between 60-80 have less survived. 
# 
# So, even if "Age" is not correlated with "Survived", we can see that there is age categories of passengers that of have more or less chance to survive.
# 
# It seems that very young passengers have more chance to survive.

# In[ ]:


# Explore Age distibution 
g = sns.kdeplot(train["Age"][(train["Survived"] == 0) & (train["Age"].notnull())], color="Red", shade = True)

g.set_ylabel("Frequency")
g = g.legend(["Not Survived","Survived"])


# When we superimpose the two densities , we cleary see a peak correponsing (between 0 and 5) to babies and very young childrens.

# #### Fare

# In[ ]:


dataset["Fare"].isnull().sum()


# In[ ]:


#Fill Fare missing values with the median value
dataset["Fare"] = dataset["Fare"].fillna(dataset["Fare"].median())


# Since we have one missing value , i decided to fill it with the median value which will not have an important effect on the prediction.

# In[ ]:


# Explore Fare distribution 
g = sns.distplot(dataset["Fare"], color="m", label="Skewness : %.2f"%(dataset["Fare"].skew()))
g = g.legend(loc="best")


# As we can see, Fare distribution is very skewed. This can lead to overweigth very high values in the model, even if it is scaled. 
# 
# In this case, it is better to transform it with the log function to reduce this skew. 

# In[ ]:


# Apply log to Fare to reduce skewness distribution
dataset["Fare"] = dataset["Fare"].map(lambda i: np.log(i) if i > 0 else 0)


# In[ ]:


g = sns.distplot(dataset["Fare"], color="b", label="Skewness : %.2f"%(dataset["Fare"].skew()))

# Skewness is clearly reduced after the log transformation

# ### 3.2 Categorical values
# #### Sex

# In[ ]:


g = sns.barplot(x="Sex",y="Survived",data=train)
g = g.set_ylabel("Survival Probability")


# In[ ]:


train[["Sex","Survived"]].groupby('Sex').mean()


# It is clearly obvious that Male have less chance to survive than Female.
# 
# So Sex, might play an important role in the prediction of the survival.
# 
# For those who have seen the Titanic movie (1997), I am sure, we all remember this sentence during the evacuation : "Women and children first". 

# #### Pclass

# In[ ]:


# Explore Pclass vs Survived
g = sns.factorplot(x="Pclass",y="Survived",data=train,kind="bar", size = 6 , 
palette = "muted")

                   size=6, kind="bar", palette="muted")
g.despine(left=True)
g = g.set_ylabels("survival probability")


# The passenger survival is not the same in the 3 classes. First class passengers have more chance to survive than second class and third class passengers.
# 
# This trend is conserved when we look at both male and female passengers.

# #### Embarked

# In[ ]:


dataset["Embarked"].isnull().sum()


# In[ ]:


#Fill Embarked nan values of dataset set with 'S' most frequent value
dataset["Embarked"] = dataset["Embarked"].fillna("S")


# Since we have two missing values , i decided to fill them with the most fequent value of "Embarked" (S).

# In[ ]:


# Explore Embarked vs Survived 
g = sns.factorplot(x="Embarked", y="Survived",  data=train,
                   size=6, kind="bar", palette="muted")
g.despine(left=True)
g = g.set_ylabels("survival probability")


# It seems that passenger coming from Cherbourg (C) have more chance to survive.
# 
# My hypothesis is that the proportion of first class passengers is higher for those who came from Cherbourg than Queenstown (Q), Southampton (S).
# 
# Let's see the Pclass distribution vs Embarked

# In[ ]:


# Explore Pclass vs Embarked 
g = sns.factorplot("Pclass", col="Embarked",  data=train,
                   size=6, kind="count", palette="muted")
g.despine(left=True)
g = g.set_ylabels("Count")


# Marked by Allen: Try with another way to present the data in below:
# It is clear to see that the passenger boarding from C has the highest percentage that went to first class, when compared with that of S and Q.

# In[ ]:


sns.axes_style("darkgrid")
g = sns.factorplot(x="Embarked", hue="Pclass", data=train,
                   size=6, aspect=2, kind="count", palette="muted")
g.despine(left=False)
g = g.set_ylabels("Passegner Count")


# Indeed, the third class is the most frequent for passenger coming from Southampton (S) and Queenstown (Q), whereas Cherbourg passengers are mostly in first class which have the highest survival rate.
# 
# At this point, i can't explain why first class has an higher survival rate. My hypothesis is that first class passengers were prioritised during the evacuation due to their influence.

# ## 4. Filling missing Values
# ### 4.1 Age
# 
# As we see, Age column contains 256 missing values in the whole dataset.
# 
# Since there is subpopulations that have more chance to survive (children for example), it is preferable to keep the age feature and to impute the missing values. 
# 
# To adress this problem, i looked at the most correlated features with Age (Sex, Parch , Pclass and SibSP).

# In[ ]:


# Explore Age vs Sex, Parch , Pclass and SibSP
g = sns.factorplot(y="Age",x="Sex",data=dataset,kind="box")
g = sns.factorplot(y="Age",x="Sex",hue="Pclass", data=dataset,kind="box")
g = sns.factorplot(y="Age",x="Parch", data=dataset,kind="box")
g = sns.factorplot(y="Age",x="SibSp", data=dataset,kind="box")


# Age distribution seems to be the same in Male and Female subpopulations, so Sex is not informative to predict Age.
# 
# However, 1rst class passengers are older than 2nd class passengers who are also older than 3rd class passengers.
# 
# Moreover, the more a passenger has parents/children the older he is and the more a passenger has siblings/spouses the younger he is.

# In[ ]:


# convert Sex into categorical value 0 for male and 1 for female
dataset["Sex"] = dataset["Sex"].map({"male": 0, "female":1})


# In[ ]:


g = sns.heatmap(dataset[["Age","Sex","SibSp","Parch","Pclass"]].corr(),cmap="BrBG",annot=True)


# The correlation map confirms the factorplots observations except for Parch. Age is not correlated with Sex, but is negatively correlated with Pclass, Parch and SibSp.
# 
# In the plot of Age in function of Parch, Age is growing with the number of parents / children. But the general correlation is negative.
# 
# So, i decided to use SibSP, Parch and Pclass in order to impute the missing ages.
# 
# The strategy is to fill Age with the median age of similar rows according to Pclass, Parch and SibSp.

# In[ ]:


# Filling missing value of Age 

## Fill Age with the median age of similar rows according to Pclass, Parch and SibSp
# Index of NaN age rows
index_NaN_age = list(dataset["Age"][dataset["Age"].isnull()].index)

for i in index_NaN_age :

# In[ ]:


g = sns.factorplot(x="Survived", y = "Age",data = train, kind="box")
g = sns.factorplot(x="Survived", y = "Age",data = train, kind="violin")


# No difference between median value of age in survived and not survived subpopulation. 
# 
# But in the violin plot of survived passengers, we still notice that very young passengers have higher survival rate.

# ## 5. Feature engineering
# ### 5.1 Name/Title

# In[ ]:


dataset["Name"].head()


# The Name feature contains information on passenger's title.

# Since some passenger with distingused title may be preferred during the evacuation, it is interesting to add them to the model.

# "Women and children first" 
# 
# It is interesting to note that passengers with rare title have more chance to survive.

# In[ ]:


# Drop Name variable
dataset.drop(labels = ["Name"], axis = 1, inplace = True)


# ### 5.2 Family size
# 
# We can imagine that large families will have more difficulties to evacuate, looking for theirs sisters/brothers/parents during the evacuation. So, i choosed to create a "Fize" (family size) feature which is the sum of SibSp , Parch and 1 (including the passenger).

# I plot the feature importance for the 4 tree based classifiers (Adaboost, ExtraTrees, RandomForest and GradientBoosting).
# 
# We note that the four classifiers have different top features according to the relative importance. It means that their predictions are not based on the same features. Nevertheless, they share some common important features for the classification , for example 'Fare', 'Title_2', 'Age' and 'Sex'.
# 
# Title_2 which indicates the Mrs/Mlle/Mme/Miss/Ms category is highly correlated with Sex.
# 
# We can say that: 
# 
# - Pc_1, Pc_2, Pc_3 and Fare refer to the general social standing of passengers.
# 
# - Sex and Title_2 (Mrs/Mlle/Mme/Miss/Ms) and Title_3 (Mr) refer to the gender.
# 
# - Age and Title_1 (Master) refer to the age of passengers.
# 
# - Fsize, LargeF, MedF, Single refer to the size of the passenger family.
# 
# **According to the feature importance of this 4 classifiers, the prediction of the survival seems to be more associated with the Age, the Sex, the family size and the social standing of the passengers more than the location in the boat.**
