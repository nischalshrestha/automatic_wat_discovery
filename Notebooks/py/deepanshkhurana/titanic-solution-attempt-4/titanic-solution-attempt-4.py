# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

#As we can see there are some missing values in 'Age', let's inspect the data

#As suspected 'Age' has NaN values. To fix them we can substitute the ages with the 50% quartite age which is 29.69, roughly 30.

#There are also NaN values in test_data's 'Fare' column. We'll just replace it with the 50% quartite fare as well.
test_data['Fare'] = test_data['Fare'].fillna(14.45)

#For our model to work, we will also need to change the age to numeric values.
#We'll use a simple convention where female=1, male=0

#It's clear we're looking at the 'Survived' column when we're looking to make predictions.

y = train_data.Survived


# # Creating X
# 
# Let's start defining our X now. We can see that most columns would affect the survival rate of the passengers.
# 
# Let's say the following columns affect the survival rate. Namely,
# 
# * Pclass
# * Sex
# * Age
# * SibSp
# * Parch
# * Fare
# 
# The reason I've chosen to ignore ticket, cabin, and embarked is because none of them are of obvious significance. The fare is included because more affluent people could have access to better cabins and facilities. In general, affluent people would have larger chances because of their position in the hierarchy. This isn't true but an assumption on my part.
