The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data. so let's have an example let's you have a dataset with like 100 people and their interests and you would like to group them according to interests, see no labels are here. simple?"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"40e7cade65637e80b8520480acbffb0e6ddbb32f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Classification vs. Regression\nAs you know, predicting Titanic survivors is a supervised classification Machine Learning problem, where you classify a passenger as either survived, or not survived.

It can be a frustrating part of data science, especially if you're newer to the field and don't have a lot of experience. For dealing with missing values, you'll need to use your intution to figure out why the value is missing. One of the most important question you can ask yourself to help figure this out is this:\n\n    Is this value missing becuase it wasn't recorded or becuase it dosen't exist?\n\nIf a value is missing becuase it doens't exist  then it doesn't make sense to try and guess what it might be. These values you probalby do want to keep as NaN. On the other hand, if a value is missing becuase it wasn't recorded like for example here in Embarked, Age columns, then you can try to guess what it might have been based on the other values in that column and row.

With this we can fix the limit of quality . that will helpful for controlling the quality .\n\nIf we take one sample out of the universe and calculate the mean size of growing then it will normal distribution This means that many kinds of statistical tests can be derived for normal distributions.
