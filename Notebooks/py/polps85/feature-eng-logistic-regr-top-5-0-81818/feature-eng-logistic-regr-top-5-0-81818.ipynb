Keep in mind that these are just 2 of the hundreds you can find in the forum and most of them are equally valuable. Comments and answers to notebooks are another rich source of knowledge that it is worth to spend some time on ([Chris Deotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte) is one of the most active in this sense).\n\nWith this notebook you will reach 0.81818 which is Top 5% at the time of writing by using simple Logistic Regression and little feature engineering. One of the key steps that allowed me to make a jump in the score was a correction in the dataset that I made when I grouped all the passengers by family, as you will see later down in the notebook.\n\nOf course any comment or suggestion is more than welcome, thank you!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"40d54571dc09a2670e4f25d2e359370d09fe8c2d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Let's start!\n\nFirst thing to do, as always, is importing all the libraries we are going to use."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"da38c46694ca05cf930e1d88496767a4841b8e66"},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom itertools import count\nfrom IPython.display import display, Image\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)\npd.set_option('display.width', 1000)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"645c06edd146ba4b6aa5c99bfd2fa031a2706bc6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, we join train and test dataframes in order to do all the processing (filling, cleaning, engineering) all at once.

To do that we check the correlation matrix which, in our case, is a matrix containing the [Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) between all the features involved. In short, PCC has value between -1 and 1 and gives an indication on how much 2 variables are linearly correlated. The higher the value (absolute value) the stronger the linear correlation (positive or negative) between the variables. Value of 0 or in general close to 0 means there is no or very low correlation.\n\nI wrote a small function to display a correlation matrix containing all the features whose PCC with the target variable is higher than a threshold. At this step we set this threshold to be 0 in order to show all the features, later we are going to use different values.

Not surprising at all: women survive more than men.\n\n\n-  It has a POSITIVE linear correlation with the feature <b><i>Fare</i></b>. It means that the higher the Fare the higher the chances of survival. This makes sense because, as a general rule, the most expensive tickets are bought by rich people who belong to the 1st/2nd class.\n\n\n-  It has a NEGATIVE linear correlation with the feature <b><i>Pclass</i></b>. Remember: here classes are represented as integers (1, 2, 3) and the PCC being negative is simply telling us that the higher the class (the integer, not from a social point of view) the lower the chances of survival, which of course makes sense and is consistent with the \"survival rate vs class\" plot I have shown at the beginning. But we can go ahead in the analysis: that plot also shows us that there is NOT obvious difference between 1st and 2nd class passengers. Actually women and children from 2nd class seem to have comparable or even higher survival rate than women and children in 1st class. I thought that this aspect might be misleading for the algorithm and decided to transform <b><i>Pclass</i></b> into a categorical feature, as we will see later.\n\n\n-  It does NOT show any evident linear correlation with <b><i>Parch</i></b>, <b><i>SibSp</i></b> and <b><i>Age</i></b>. Regarding the first two, as many of you have already said, it is often good practice to combine feature that individually have PCC close to 0 and try to create a new feature with higher PCC. We will do this by creating the feature called \"FamSize\".\n\n\n-  The apparently random relation betweeen <b><i>Survived</i></b> and <b><i>Age</i></b> might look weird but it actually makes more sense after a deeper analysis. Thinking carefully about the problem, during those confused moments right after hitting the iceberg nobody was really caring about the actual age of the passengers. The only important thing was whether the passenger was a child or not. For the rest, passengers of age 20, 30, 50 or whatever they were all treated in the same way (we are not interested here in passenger's sex or class). This is the reason why the PCC is failing at this specific task. In this new scenario, we need to modify the feature <b><i>Age</i></b> and make it binary.
