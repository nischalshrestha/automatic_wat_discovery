On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an   iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\nOur aim is to predict the survival of passengers(whether they survive or perish) based on available features. This is a Binary classification: Supervised learning problem where we have to train a model to labeled outcome data(training set) and use this trained model to predict outcomes of test set.\n\n\n![](https://adilashkare.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/getting-start-titanic.jpg)\n\nDownload the three data files from the data Section and read the Data Description carefully.\n\n### *Data description:*\nThe training set is used to build our machine learning models. For the training set, the outcome is already provided for each passenger. Our model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class.\nThe test set should be used to see how well our model performs on unseen data. For the test set, the outcome is not provided and it’s our job to predict these outcomes.\nThere’s also a gender_submission csv file,which is a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.\n\nSurvived: This is the outcome variable which is only present in the training set.\n0 = No (perished)\n1 = Yes (survived)"},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"9bb870dcfae6372f853e8ecea6f33a4f6ce1e9e4","trusted":true,"_cell_guid":"0fa9c42f-9105-4764-94b7-0713737cd4cf","_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"#remove everything in the working environment.\nrm(list =ls())\ncat(\"\\14\") #clears console\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ae026e0996fb5ba8fab674b97c69672c19a48b27"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The sheer power of R lies in its incredible packages.
