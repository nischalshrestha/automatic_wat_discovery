# This R environment comes with all of CRAN preinstalled, as well as many other helpful packages

# The environment is defined by the kaggle/rstats docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-rstats

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 



library('ggplot2') # Data visualization

library('readr') # CSV file I/O, e.g. the read_csv function

library('ggthemes') # visualization

library('scales') # visualization

library('dplyr') # data manipulation

library('mice') # imputation

library('randomForest') # classification algorithm

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory



system("ls ../input")



# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
train <- read.csv('../input/train.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)

test  <- read.csv('../input/test.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)

# check data

str(full)
# Grab title from passenger names

# Show title counts by sex

# Titles with very low cell counts to be combined to "rare" level

                'Dr', 'Major', 'Rev', 'Sir', 'Jonkheer')



# Also reassign mlle, ms, and mme accordingly

# Show title counts by sex again

# Finally, grab surname from passenger name
