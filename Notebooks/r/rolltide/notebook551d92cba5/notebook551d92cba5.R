# This R environment comes with all of CRAN preinstalled, as well as many other helpful packages

# The environment is defined by the kaggle/rstats docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-rstats

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 



library(ggplot2) # Data visualization

library(readr) # CSV file I/O, e.g. the read_csv function



# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory



system("ls ../input")



# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
